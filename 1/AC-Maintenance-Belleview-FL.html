<p>The likelihood of immediate responses to indoor air pollutants depends on a number of elements. Age and preexisting medical conditions are 2 important influences.

<p>Filters can get filthy easily, especially if you live in an area that can be dusty. The HVAC system filters trap all kinds of dust, particles, germs, and tidy the air.
