<p>Packaged terminal air conditioning unit (PTAC) systems are also known as wall-split a/c systems. 45 They are ductless systems.

This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems might be adjusted to supply heating in winter, either straight by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating system, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the outside air, transforming the air conditioning system into a heatpump While room cooling offers optimum versatility, when used to cool lots of rooms at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
