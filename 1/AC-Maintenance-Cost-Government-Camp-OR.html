<p>Packaged terminal a/c (PTAC) systems are likewise known as wall-split cooling systems. 45 They are ductless systems. PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing system on the exterior, with an opening passing through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and permits each room to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems may be adjusted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the air conditioner into a heatpump While room a/c offers maximum flexibility, when utilized to cool many rooms at a time it is generally more expensive than central air.<p>

<p>Central air conditioning conditioners, often referred to as central air" or split-system cooling", distribute cool air through a system of supply and return ducts. Supply ducts and signs up (i.e., openings in the floorings, walls, or ceilings covered by grills) carry cooled air from the a/c unit to the house. This cooled air ends up being warmer as it distributes through the house; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and signs up. Learn how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
