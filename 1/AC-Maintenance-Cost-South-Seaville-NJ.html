<p>It prevails to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the frustrating bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably the same physical material with time.

Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of structures, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
