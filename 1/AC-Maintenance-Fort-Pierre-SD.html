<h3>HVAC Maintenance Technician in Fort Pierre SD</h3>
<p>We called Elite A/C on among the most popular days of summertime( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent out some1 out exact same day to assess scenario & chose to opt for them for the work. I am happy to say that not only did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating system which was old. Everybody we talked to from beginning to end were very professional, courteous and the work was very efficiently done. I would highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Terrific service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely comprehensive in discussing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied fantastic customer service at the end of the consultation by discussing precisely what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few tips of some maintenance jobs we might want to have actually carried out in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale methods used by some in the market.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everybody can pay for, numerous Seattleites need to find ways to fight the heat without a duct system. In 2015 the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Condition Service. Meanwhile, in huge box stores like Finest Buy, the box fans and window AC systems are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the country to deal with the truth of a terrible, terrible summer season.<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around troubleshooting the problem, all the while describing whatever to me. After finding the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
