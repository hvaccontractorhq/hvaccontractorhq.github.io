<p>Air toxins can range from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a common air contaminant resulting from natural gas that escapes into your house without being burnt. Older houses might consist of asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and kitchen areas, mold and mildew can become a nuisance where wetness levels are usually greater than in the rest of your house.<p>
<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens originate from plants; infections are transmitted by animals and individuals; bacteria are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Polluted central air handling systems can become reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these pollutants through the home.<p>
