<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that wetness has to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're simply requesting mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Speaking of laundry, changing from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a reliable and simple technique to minimize ambient air contamination and possible health risks, according to a 2018 study in the journal Air Quality, Environment & Health.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you might want to speak with a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump systems can have different heating and cooling capacities. You may look for a heat pump more geared toward cooling capability and performance if you currently have a home heating system. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to look for a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. Fortunately is that the one significant disadvantage of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
