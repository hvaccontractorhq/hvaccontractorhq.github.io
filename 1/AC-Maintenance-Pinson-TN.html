<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair demand, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx consumers don't understand why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice build-up is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's most likely your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to defrost your air conditioning devices.
