<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also evidence from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality issues. Ventilation system filters that are not replaced regularly may become clogged, reducing air circulation quality, distribution, and volume. They also may become places for molds and bacteria to be and grow dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems likewise need to be properly maintained to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>If you use an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system, consider prospective impacts of indoor air pollution. Follow the manufacturer's instructions, particularly directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit appropriately changed. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is usually an indicator of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating system is in usage, open a door from the room where the heater is located to the rest of the house and open a window slightly.<p>
