<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not offer auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money can be found in on a monthly basis, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do choose to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There ought to not be any reason why your company can not provide this.
