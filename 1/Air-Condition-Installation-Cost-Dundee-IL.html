<p>7 To evaluate it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature level, and then change it ON. To prevent straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait at least five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.

<h3>AC Service in Dundee IL</h3>
<p>Remember that the SEER rating is determined using the exact same set of temperatures across the board. The average summer season temperature level to arrive at the SEER rating is 83 degrees, so to reach the correct SEER score for your area, subtract 2 points for each 10 degrees over 83. The minimum SEER ranking has to be at least 13 for all brand-new a/c units manufactured in the United States.<p>
<p>While these actions will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leak in your AC system can cause expensive compressor failure, but a house owner does not have the abilities or tools essential to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and correct airflow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the essential devices for the task. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a smart homeowner, it's still required to have a professional technician inspect the system periodically.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the big picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be established to offer threshold signals. If, for example, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your tracking devices to signal you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to resolve the circumstance immediately.<p>
