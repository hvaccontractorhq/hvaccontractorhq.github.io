<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost excellent however Mark headed out of his method to customize a couple of things in my home to make the general air flow more enhanced. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>If you think a mold problem-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a moldy smell regularly originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and preserve. Leaky return ducts can also introduce moisture. Again, if you think a mold issue, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>

<h3>Water Source Heat Pump in Frankston TX</h3>
<p>I have actually been utilizing them for years for my organisations, my own houses and my real estate customers' houses. I went through five other companies prior to I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control. All five other companies estimated me with different costs and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me thoroughly the concerns which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. He helped me trouble shoot the concern when I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a penny to have the system working once again. He is sincere, reputable, and reasonable on price. It's difficult to find a truthful AC man and I'm pleased I discovered Luis. Highly recommend Luis and his company.<p>
