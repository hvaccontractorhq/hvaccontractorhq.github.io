<p>The primary problem when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones.

Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, since some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the a/c individually for each room. However, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
