<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one constraint: their overall power must not go beyond the capacity of the outside system. In practice, nevertheless, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. However, it is wrong to anticipate much better performance when all indoor systems are switched on at the same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is limited by the capacity of the outside system. Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not basic, considering that it takes into account not only the small power of the systems, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
