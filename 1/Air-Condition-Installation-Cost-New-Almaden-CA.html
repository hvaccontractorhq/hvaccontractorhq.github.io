<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the typical home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is lowered, however it is also more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The results can be rather substantial if the entering air is dry enough.<p>
