<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Pell City AL Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with questions. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, showed up and provided with a 2 day turn around (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex properly recommended me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the expected quantity of time. post set up assessment outcomes look very good for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 unit it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean up the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up at least one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "tough part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
