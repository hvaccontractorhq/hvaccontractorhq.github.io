<p>Current Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
