<p>Aside from space heating, the geothermal heating system can likewise be connected to a gadget referred to as a geothermal desuperheater.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature is often in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system must briefly switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
