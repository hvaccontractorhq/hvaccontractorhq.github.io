<p>A specialized a/c that is used just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise utilizes a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c in that both the evaporator and the condenser are put in the exact same air course. Because its condenser coil launches heat outside, a standard air conditioner transfers heat energy out of the space. However, considering that all parts of the dehumidifier remain in the same space, no heat energy is removed. Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the space is actually heated up, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
