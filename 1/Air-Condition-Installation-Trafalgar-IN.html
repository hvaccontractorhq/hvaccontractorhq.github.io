If you've set up the parts shown and re-installed the disconnect block, repowered the circuit breaker, switched on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and decreased the temperature below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after thirty minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
