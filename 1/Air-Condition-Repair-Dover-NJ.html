<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy finishing the wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new breaker and last connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. As soon as the circuitry is total, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly cure and solidify-- typically 2 to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a game of Scrabble on your relaxing, warm restroom floor.<p>
