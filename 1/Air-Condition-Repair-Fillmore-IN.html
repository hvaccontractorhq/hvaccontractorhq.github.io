Because they don't require any brand-new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention procedure.
