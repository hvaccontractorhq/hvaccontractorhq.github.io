<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was really educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 years of age furnace.)

Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).
