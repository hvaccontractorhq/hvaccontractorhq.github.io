(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem breaker journeys. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>
