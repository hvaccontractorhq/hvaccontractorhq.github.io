<p>All of us face a range of risks to our health as we set about our day-to-day lives. Driving in cars and trucks, flying in planes, participating in recreational activities, and being exposed to environmental pollutants all position differing degrees of danger. Some threats are simply inevitable. Some we select to accept due to the fact that to do otherwise would limit our capability to lead our lives the way we desire. And some are dangers we might choose to prevent if we had the chance to make educated options. Indoor air contamination is one risk that you can do something about.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not use them.. Second of all like extended auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover very little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the required skills to do the job and also the morals to treat customers fairly. As a consumer you require to be well notified in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Finally discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has actually been running issue free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
