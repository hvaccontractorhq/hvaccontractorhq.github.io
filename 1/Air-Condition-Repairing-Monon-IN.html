<p>The guidelines that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the brand-new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the very same. Once the wiring is complete, energize the system for a few minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly harden and treat-- usually two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm bathroom floor.<p>
