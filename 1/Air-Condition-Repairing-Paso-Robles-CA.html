<p>Inspect these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged, the lowered airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually resolved the problem.<p>

But more intricate issues-- identified by regularly undesirable air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the issue you're experiencing, one of the 3 strategies listed below might be proper.<p>
