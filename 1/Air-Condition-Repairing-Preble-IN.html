<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based.
