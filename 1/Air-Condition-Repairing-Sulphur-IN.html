<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most extensively used in dry cleaning. In lab research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Recent research studies show that individuals breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are stored and as they use dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners regain the perchloroethylene throughout the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they remove more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not eliminate as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your direct exposure to this chemical is prudent. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them until they have been correctly dried. Try a different dry cleaner if products with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs.<p>
