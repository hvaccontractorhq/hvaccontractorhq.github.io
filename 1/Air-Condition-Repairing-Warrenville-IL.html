<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Look for a basic wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to complete. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I chose to final progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost great however Mark headed out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
