<p>WE ARE ALSO OFFERING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT CONSULTATIONS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline in between the pipes going into and the water pipe leaving the traditional water heater. Install a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will flow from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperatures are high, and the standard hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>
<p>Air ducts are responsible for distributing hot and cold air throughout your home, providing a comfortable environment in every space. But ducts that are not set up correctly or preserved can disperse contaminants from one space to another. With time, dust, dander and even mold can collect in your ducts, decreasing the overall air quality. Hire an expert to ensure your ducts are flowing fresh, tidy air.<p>

<h3>Duct Cleaning On Your West Plains MO Home</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air straight from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct handle air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is probably wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
