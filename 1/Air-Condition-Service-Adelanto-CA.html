<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to end up. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. Once I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark went out of his way to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more enhanced.
