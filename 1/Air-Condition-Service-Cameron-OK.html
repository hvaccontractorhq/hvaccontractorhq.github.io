<p>Even the quietest condensers make noise, so work with your contractor to discover a location that's not near a bedroom or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or completely confine it since it tires warm air out the top. Any airflow restriction will reduce the unit's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can easily flow around it.<p>
