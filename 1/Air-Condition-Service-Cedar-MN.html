<p>Terrific service within 24 hr and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and really thorough in discussing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn provided fantastic client service at the end of the consultation by describing exactly what he had done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few suggestions of some maintenance tasks we might want to have performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics employed by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Keep in mind, too, that you may want to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as various heat pump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a house heating unit, you may try to find a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capacity and efficiency. For a higher-end design to look after your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally wish to try to find a design that will have sufficient heating for the cold Seattle winters. The good news is that the one significant drawback of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Noise area.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) might not be the most pernicious element affecting indoor air quality, however it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a space or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from rising too high-- which can have an unfavorable influence on residents-- outside air needs to be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
