<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" discovered something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I grumbled and got a refund) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the residential or commercial property.<p>
<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus needs conditions suitable for both organisms.

Preventive steps consist of changing typical warm water levels to permit 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating center design layout, removing faucet aerators, and periodic testing in suspect areas.<p>
