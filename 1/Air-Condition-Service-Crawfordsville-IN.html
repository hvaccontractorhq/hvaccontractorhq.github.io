<p>It is common to presume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady over time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
