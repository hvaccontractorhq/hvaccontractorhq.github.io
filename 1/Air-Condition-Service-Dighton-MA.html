Not only was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more enhanced.

<p>Central air systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's capability to cool your house. For example, a 1 heap unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it suggests the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>They were great! So many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They satisfied my requirements entirely by providing a professional quote with choices, without pushing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The also without delay followed up with the necessary evaluations from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>

If at any point in the process of bleeding the furnace something seems unusual or you lose confidence, it's time to call a professional.
