This bypass mode can be used in the summer season when water temperatures are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down completely.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two service technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
