Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to distribute cool air from the air conditioning system.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c works but the house doesn't cool, the problem is probably in the distribution system.<p>

<h3>Central Air Conditioner Installation in Fountain Inn SC</h3>
<p>I normally don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You do not prepare for needing to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my options. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over options. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to offer you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my requirements entirely by providing a professional quote with alternatives, without pressing additional items. The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the essential assessments from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as essential when it concerns central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the house cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to effectively cool the home on hot days. Thinking about bigger units cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
