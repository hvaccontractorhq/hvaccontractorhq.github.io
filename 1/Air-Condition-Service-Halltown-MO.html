<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair in Halltown MO</h3>
<p>A split a/c system may cost near to that of a traditional HVAC system but has actually proven to be an alternative cost reliable option to houses that do not have ductwork. Utilized along with other kinds of heating or cooling, such as portable or window air conditioning system, area heaters, or oil heating units, it can boost the comfort of your home while keeping your regular monthly utility expense reasonable.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be fulfilled without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually chilled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
