<p>For each load of laundry you dry, that moisture needs to go somewhere. If your dryer is vented to the garage or basement, you're just requesting for mold accumulation, says Dr. Khatri. Mentioning laundry, switching from fragranced to fragrance-free items can be a uncomplicated and effective  technique to reduce ambient air pollution and prospective health risks, according to a 2018 research study in the journal Air Quality, Atmosphere & Health.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge toxins.)

Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
