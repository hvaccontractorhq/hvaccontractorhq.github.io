Structures constantly progress as a result of the changes in the environment around them in addition to the residents, materials, and activities within them. The various surface areas and the air inside a structure are constantly connecting, and this interaction leads to changes in each. For instance, we may see a window as altering somewhat with time as it becomes dirty, then is cleaned up, builds up dirt once again, is cleaned up again, and so on through its life. In fact, the dirt" we see might be evolving as an outcome of the interactions amongst the wetness, chemicals, and biological materials discovered there.<p>
<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Dirty filters are the most common cause of furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, change the filter. A dirty filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
