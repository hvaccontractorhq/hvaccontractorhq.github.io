<h3>Central Heating Repair in Abbeville SC</h3>
<p>Ducted heat pump heating and cooling systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces by means of a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most affordable. Using existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
