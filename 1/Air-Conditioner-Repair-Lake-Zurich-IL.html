<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you may think. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "steady state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be calibrated frequently, and outside measurements used for calculations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
