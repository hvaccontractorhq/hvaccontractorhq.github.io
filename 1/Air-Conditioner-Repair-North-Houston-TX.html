<p>When installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones, the primary problem. While installing a separate split system, employees try to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system develops more troubles, considering that some of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling individually for each room. However, now the market has a wide selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical characteristics of indoor systems operate individually from each other.<p>
