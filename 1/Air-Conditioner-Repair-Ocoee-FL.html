The choice of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power must not surpass the capability of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor units greater than the outdoor capacity by a minimum of 20%. However, it is incorrect to expect much better performance when all indoor systems are turned on at the same time, since the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outside system. Simply put, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a very comfy temperature level. However, the estimation of the overall power is not easy, because it takes into consideration not only the nominal power of the units, but likewise the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
