<p>A heating and air-conditioning contractor sizes the furnace to your house's square video footage. They utilize a series of calculations based upon the British Thermal Units or BTUs required to heat the space. The bigger the area, the more effective the house heating unit needs to be.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to temporarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
