<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL COMFORT ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipe in between the pipes entering and the pipes leaving the standard hot water heater. Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the conventional hot water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes entering and the water pipe leaving the conventional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the traditional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
