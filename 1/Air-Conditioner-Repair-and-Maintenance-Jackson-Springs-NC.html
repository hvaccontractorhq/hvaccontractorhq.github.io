These aspects consist of bad ventilation (lack of outside air), issues controlling temperature, low or high humidity, current remodeling, and other activities in or near a structure that can impact the fresh air entering the building. In some cases, particular contaminants like dust from building and construction or restoration, mold, cleaning products, pesticides, or other air-borne chemicals (consisting of percentages of chemicals released as a gas gradually) might trigger bad IAQ.<p>
