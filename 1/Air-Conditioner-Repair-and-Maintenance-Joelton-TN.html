<p>Mobile homes are typically smaller than stick-built homes and use significantly less oil and a much smaller furnace to heat.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice kinds on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system should briefly change back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
