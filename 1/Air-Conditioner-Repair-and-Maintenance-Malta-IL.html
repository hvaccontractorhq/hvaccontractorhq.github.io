<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'car oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' cause an issue in the future.

<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have actually found them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater due to the fact that the technicians thought they simply didn't appear best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
