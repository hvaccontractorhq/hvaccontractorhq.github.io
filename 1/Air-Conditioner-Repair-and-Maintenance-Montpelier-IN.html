<p>Even the quietest condensers make sounds, so work with your contractor to find a location that's not near a bed room or home-office window. Do not put the condenser under a deck or entirely enclose it because it exhausts warm air out the top. Any air flow restriction will reduce the system's performance. You can, however, conceal the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely flow around it.<p>
<p>Additionally, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces warmed by radiators are prone to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the space and very hot next to the radiators. This typically leads to opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go again, letting all that energy paid to heat up your house escape out of the window. Convected heat provides warmth from the floor up throughout the room with no cold areas or stuffiness in the area being heated up.<p>
<p>Normally the most efficient way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of specific sources of contamination or to reduce their emissions. Some sources, like those which contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. Oftentimes, source control is also a more cost-efficient approach to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation since increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are noted later in this area.<p>
<p>Since my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung out troubleshooting the issue, all the while explaining everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me.
