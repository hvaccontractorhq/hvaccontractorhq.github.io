<p>Today, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, construction debris, and mold may be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe as well as the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system.

Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop in between the surface systems and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These various heat sources also determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer utilizing an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
<p>Place the solar tank near the standard hot water heater. Make sure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the hot and cold water connections are accessible if the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank.

Set up unions at the storage tank and heat exchanger connections so that the piping will not have to be cut if the tank or heat exchanger ever need to be replaced.<p>

<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions. He devoted to the job based only on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the couple of affordable ones received. Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name devices. I got Provider. ProTex effectively advised me against increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install team was respectful of my house and set up the devices in the expected amount of time. post install assessment results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New system cools much better than the 13 years of age 4 lot R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
