The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works however the house doesn't cool, the issue is most likely in the circulation system.<p>

<h3>Three Essential Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Bountiful UT</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need fairly little attention. But, similar to any mechanical system, some fundamental maintenance is necessary to keep the system working smoothly. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of traditional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank ought to be looked for leakages, the system should be flushed regularly to eliminate tank and gathered impurities (scaling in difficult water areas). The systems need to be inspected at least twice each year for a proper operation of the pump, controller and sensing units. The collector's glass can be rinsed periodically to get rid of dust gathered in order to enhance collector performance.<p>
<p>Inspect these three things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are wide open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If numerous registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or until there's great air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
