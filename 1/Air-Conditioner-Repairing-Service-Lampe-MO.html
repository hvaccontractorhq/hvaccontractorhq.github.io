This company presented a service agreement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. During the inspection on a very cold day they eliminated the furnace claiming health threat reason and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new home owner I have actually learned how to identify the sincere HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>
