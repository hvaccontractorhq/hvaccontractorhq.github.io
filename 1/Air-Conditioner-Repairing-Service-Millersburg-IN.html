<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
