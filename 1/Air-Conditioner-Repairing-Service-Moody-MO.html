Then tug the detach block (Picture 1) and tidy the condenser coils (Image 2). If the cooling service still doesn't work appropriately after you have actually cleaned up the condenser coils, set up a new filter and opened all the supply vents, continue with the following repairs. Your AC won't work completely unless you do this.<p>
