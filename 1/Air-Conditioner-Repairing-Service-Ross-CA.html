<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Ross CA</h3>
<p>When you and your family walk into your home in Sacramento, CA, are you as comfortable as you can be?

<p>The evaporator coil is more than likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and try once again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
