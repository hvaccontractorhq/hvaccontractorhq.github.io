<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you might require a reference later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors ought to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the brand-new capacitor (Image 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
