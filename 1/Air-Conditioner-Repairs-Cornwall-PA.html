<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation.
