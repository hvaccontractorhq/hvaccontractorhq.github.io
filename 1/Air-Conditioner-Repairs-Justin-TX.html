<h3>Ducted Air Conditioning Prices in Justin TX</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, affordable versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units use capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on. With time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll notice the motor running hotter. Before that happens, you wish to get those capacitors altered to avoid more damage to your system.<p>
