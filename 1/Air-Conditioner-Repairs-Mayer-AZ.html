<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the new capacitor (Photo 5).<p>

What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert reviewing my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household pal and now I will recommend this company to my friends.<p>
