<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and maintaining the quality of the air around an industrial environment.

Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
