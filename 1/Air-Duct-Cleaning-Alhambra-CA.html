<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as essential when it concerns central air conditioning expenses, is the AC unit's size. A system that is too big will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too small will not be able to correctly cool the house on hot days. Considering larger systems cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC professional what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide (CO) is an odorless, colorless poisonous gas. Since it is difficult to see, taste or smell, CO can kill you prior to you know it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild impacts that are frequently mistaken for the influenza. These symptoms include headaches, lightheadedness, nausea, disorientation and tiredness. The impacts of CO direct exposure can vary greatly from individual to individual depending on age, overall health and the concentration and length of direct exposure.<p>
