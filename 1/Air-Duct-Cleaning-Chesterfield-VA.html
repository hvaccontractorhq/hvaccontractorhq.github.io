Heaters that kick on frequently might be due to a filthy filter, which is not permitting the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there may be an internal issue. While humming is triggered by a slipped belt in the internal functions, other noises such as knocking and banging can be from parts needing to be oiled or even an unclean burner.<p>
