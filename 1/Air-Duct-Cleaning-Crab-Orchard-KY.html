<h3>HVAC Technician in Crab Orchard KY</h3>
<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends out power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. One of the most common areas for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good opportunity; you may have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is showing a blank screen. The water activates your emergency security switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer. This shuts down all the 24 volts going to your furnace. There is likewise a baseplate that links to the Nest. We have seen baseplate go bad on unusual occasions.<p>
