An F" for $616 in labor expenses (defrost control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work started. Parts were covered by guarantee.

<h3>Replacing Your Boiler in East Olympia WA</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here).
