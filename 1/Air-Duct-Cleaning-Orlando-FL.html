Modern two- and three-stage furnaces increase performance even further by running at lower or greater capability depending on the heating requirements of the location.<p>

<p>When your HVAC professional tells you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as important as a routine oil change in your car. A filthy filter requires the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps impurities and debris in the air. Energy Star advises replacing your filter once every 3 months. During high use months, inspect the filters a minimum of monthly.<p>
