<p>There is a transformer in your air conditioning furnace. The transformer is what materials 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest won't begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency safety changes that secure your air conditioning system from flooding. Among the most typical places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx safety changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is revealing a blank screen, it is a likelihood; you might have a water leak in the attic.
