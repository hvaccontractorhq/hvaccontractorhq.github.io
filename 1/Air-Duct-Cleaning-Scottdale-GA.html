<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average house. In really dry environments, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during hot weather. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a damp pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, however it is also more damp, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the sensible heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the getting in air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>
