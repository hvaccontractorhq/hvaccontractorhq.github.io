<h3>Solar Heating System in Warrington PA</h3>
<p>I generally don't leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You don't expect needing to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After company hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Ask about training and accreditations. An excellent location to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's type of a minimum requirement for choosing an HVAC company, however a great deal of contractors out there have not bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by looking for Building Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Supervisors with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one aspect (out of numerous) of a comfy environment.<p>
