<p>During winter season, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the taken in heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, altering it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct outcome of the compression process. From here, the gas moves to the condenser, which transfers the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

<h3>HVAC Repair in Chelmsford MA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For example, a 1 lot system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Though it might be difficult to believe, the air inside your house can be worse than the air outside. Dust and dander are well-known for decreasing the air quality in your home, however there are lots of other toxins that can not just unclean up the air, however result in other health problems. Radon and carcinogens from cleaning supplies and building products contribute to bad air quality, and can also cause cancers. VOCs (unpredictable natural substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpeting and upholstery materials can trigger issues. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.) Nevertheless, steps such as installing storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outside air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent usage candles or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned or replaced their furnace filter. And practically 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
