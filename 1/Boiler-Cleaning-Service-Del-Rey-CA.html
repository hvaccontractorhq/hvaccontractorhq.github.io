<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor shops energy, like a battery does, to have power available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to turn on. In time, capacitors can break, and when they do, you'll observe the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>

<p>Think about potential results of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the maker's directions, especially directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heating unit correctly adjusted. A relentless yellow-tipped flame is normally an indication of maladjustment and increased toxin emissions. While a space heating system is in use, open a door from the room where the heating system is located to the rest of the home and open a window slightly.<p>
