<p>Similar to most house enhancement projects, the cost of a full central heating system can differ extensively based on the size of the home. Many heaters will last in between 15 and twenty years. In selecting a furnace, homeowner must think about heat output and efficiency. Heat output is measured in British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and the size of the furnace need to be matched to the size of the home. A little home, for instance, might not be well served by a high-BTU furnace. The furnace may heat the home too rapidly and shut off for too long, leading to irregular temperature level levels.<p>
