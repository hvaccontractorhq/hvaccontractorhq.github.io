Every maintenance task might need absolutely different actions and processes than the previous, depending upon the age and condition of the system being examined.

<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your home, a mini-split heatpump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Since up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC system may be lost to leaks in your ducts, a ductless unit has an integrated performance benefit. Because they do not need any brand-new ductwork to be set up, ductless heat pumps are excellent for additions. Since a system is set up in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
