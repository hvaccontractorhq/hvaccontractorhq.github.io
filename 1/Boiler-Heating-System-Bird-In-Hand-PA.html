<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of co2 for functions of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended period of consistent occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide ought to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for estimations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors might likewise be required.<p>
<p>Indoor environments are highly intricate and building residents may be exposed to a variety of impurities (in the kind of particles and gases) from workplace machines, cleaning products, building activities, carpets and home furnishings, fragrances, cigarette smoke, water-damaged structure materials, microbial growth (fungal, mold, and bacterial), insects, and outdoor pollutants.

<p>It prevails to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable in time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as relatively unchanged physical product gradually. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research using the approaches ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the constructed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
