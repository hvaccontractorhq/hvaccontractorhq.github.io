<p>My "C" ranking is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and efficiently, but to have 2 significant elements stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by guarantee. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than 2 hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

Next, turn off the power switch right at the furnace or air handler. Then yank the detach block (Picture 1) and clean the condenser coils (Image 2). If the air conditioning service still doesn't work effectively after you have actually cleaned the condenser coils, installed a brand-new filter and opened all the supply vents, proceed with the following repairs. Your AC will not work completely unless you do this.<p>

<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel.
