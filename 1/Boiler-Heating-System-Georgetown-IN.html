The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not use vehicle debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash coming in on a monthly basis, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. , if we do decide to provide auto debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.. There should not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
