<h3>Natural Gas Furnace Service in Highland Park Illinois</h3>

They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the check out or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and repaired the problem. Will definitely be utilizing them once again.<p>
