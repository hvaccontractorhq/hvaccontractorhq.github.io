Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, decreasing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<h3>Install Air Conditioner in Wilsonville AL</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have heard of the $5000 guideline however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires annual or perhaps bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outside furnace that I can not buy for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was more affordable for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I think they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
