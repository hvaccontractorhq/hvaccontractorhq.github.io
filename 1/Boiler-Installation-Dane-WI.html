<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to complete. I 'd priced out new systems and installation for months. As soon as I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Ton system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the cost excellent but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
