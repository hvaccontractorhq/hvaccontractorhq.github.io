<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I decided to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not only was the cost fantastic however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my home to make the general air flow more optimized. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>A customized a/c that is utilized just for dehumidifying is called a dehumidifier It likewise uses a refrigeration cycle, but varies from a basic a/c unit in that both the condenser and the evaporator are placed in the exact same air path.

Instead, the electric power consumed by the dehumidifier stays in the room as heat, so the room is really warmed, just as by an electric heating system that draws the exact same amount of power.<p>
