<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff frequently receives ask for assessment and support in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the general public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. During the 1970s, numerous house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
