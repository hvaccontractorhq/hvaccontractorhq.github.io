<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and respectful. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>
