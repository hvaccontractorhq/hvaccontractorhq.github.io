<p>In a normal residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar made to his workers, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other costs before paying himself anything. Usually this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, specifically if the goal of owning a service was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% wants the couple of years it took to develop the business and not taking an income as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% usually isn't the end objective. HVAC business owners should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their revenues while keeping expenses the exact same in all other areas.<p>
