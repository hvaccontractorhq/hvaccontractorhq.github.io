<p>The quality of the air inside our workplaces, schools and homes matters, particularly considering that we invest the majority of our lives indoors.

<p>Called WSE for a routine examination. The tech showed up right on time and was friendly & knowledgeable throughout the check out. They recommended replacing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost but a quick internet search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was extremely happy they waited their work and repaired the issue.

<p>Central air systems are determined in heaps. This measurement is based upon the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 ton system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>We advise utilizing our insulation boards when setting up over concrete slabs.
