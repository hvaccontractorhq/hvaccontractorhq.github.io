<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is because ice forms on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heatpump system must briefly switch back into the regular cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
