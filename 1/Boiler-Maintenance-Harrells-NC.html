<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new units and installation for months. When I decided to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Lot unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not only was the price fantastic but Mark went out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it actually only took them 6 hours overall time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
