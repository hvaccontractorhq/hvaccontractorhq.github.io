<p>The primary issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a separate split system, employees attempt to find both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more problems, considering that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. However, now the market has a wide choice of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
