Generally this leaves about 6% of revenues to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't sound like much, particularly if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it took to build the business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% normally isn't completion goal.
