<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you must watch out for. First, you must check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
