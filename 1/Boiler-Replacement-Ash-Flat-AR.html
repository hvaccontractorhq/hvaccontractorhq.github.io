<p>A hydronic glowing flooring heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a labyrinth of pipes set up under the floor or right within the floor surface itself.

<p>It might feel cozy being sealed in tight versus the cold in your home during the chillier months of the year, but for individuals who are delicate to indoor allergens or have respiratory problems, winter can worsen problems. Stagnant indoor air and heating systems can increase the amount of allergy-inducing dust mites, animal dander, and mold spores distributing through your house. In late winter season and early spring, it may still be too cold to toss open the windows to take out the moldy air, so while you wait for the warmer weather condition it is very important to be knowledgeable about some of the allergic reaction and breathing triggers that may be prowling in your environments.<p>
