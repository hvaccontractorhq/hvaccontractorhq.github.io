Not just was the rate great however Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the overall air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system set up. I have no doubt any future organisation associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
