<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance in Noblesville IN</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Hot water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went fantastic. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. Two as needed tankless and one high efficiency tank. The team took the entire day as they needed to eliminate the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high efficiency heating unit. We decided on getting something more pricey than a traditional water heater as gas is one of our biggest utility expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a very long time and use very little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>Because it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate.

The result is a room that doesn't appear as cool as the temperature suggests. In truth, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
