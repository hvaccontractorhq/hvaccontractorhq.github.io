<p>Recent Review: They were excellent! A lot of HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to supply you with the service originally requested. They met my requirements entirely by offering a professional quote with choices, without pressing additional items. The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
<p>Strained Systems Overheat - When your system is filthy, and filters are plugged, and maybe refrigerant is low, it will not be operating at maximum efficiency and might overheat. This makes they HVAC system work harder, producing a cycle that doesn't end. An overworked system will also trigger your energy costs to rise. It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not huge enough for your house. If the system is too small, it will have to work more difficult and may get too hot. Normally, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to set up a 5-ton unit for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
