<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
