<p>A hydronic radiant floor heat system works by heating water or glycol in a boiler and pumping it through a maze of pipes installed under the floor or right within the flooring surface itself. The heat from the warm water transfers to the flooring mass and after that radiates through thermal transfer to other posts with solid mass such as the walls, ceilings, furnishings and people. It does not depend on heating or moving air to move heat.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to set up the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.

The lack of moving parts suggests you're less likely to invest big on repairs down the line. The buried loop system can be anticipated to last for 50 years. They're significantly more effective then even the highest-efficiency air source systems.<p>
