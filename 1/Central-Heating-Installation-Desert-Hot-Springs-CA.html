<p>If you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, examine these 3 things first. Ensure all the signs up in your home are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Image 2). If a number of signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed, the reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've fixed the issue.<p>
