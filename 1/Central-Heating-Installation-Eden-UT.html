Some sources, such as constructing products, home furnishings and products like air fresheners, can release toxins more or less continuously.

Unvented or malfunctioning appliances or poorly utilized items can launch greater and often unsafe levels of pollutants inside.<p>
<p>The capability of organic chemicals to cause health effects differs greatly, from those that are highly poisonous, to those with no known health result. As with other toxins, the level and nature of the health effect will depend upon lots of elements consisting of level of direct exposure and length of time exposed. Eye and respiratory tract irritation, headaches, dizziness, visual disorders, and memory impairment are among the immediate symptoms that some individuals have actually experienced not long after exposure to some organics. At present, not much is learnt about what health impacts take place from the levels of organics generally discovered in houses. Many natural compounds are understood to cause cancer in animals; some are believed of triggering, or are understood to trigger, cancer in people.<p>
