<h3>Advantages of Ducted Heat Pumps at Fleming GA</h3>

On those days when you just can't appear to heat up and discover you require to show up your thermostat, your furnace can suck all the humidity out of your home and leave your sinuses throbbing. In-floor heating systems are not vulnerable to this concern since they heat surface areas and not the air itself.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
