<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn On Your Air Conditioner in Galena MO</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning feelings in the eyes and throat, nausea, and difficulty in breathing in some humans exposed at raised levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might trigger attacks in people with asthma. There is evidence that some individuals can establish a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has also been shown to cause cancer in animals and may cause cancer in human beings.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't rewarding you wouldn't provide them.  Secondly like prolonged auto warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the unit has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
