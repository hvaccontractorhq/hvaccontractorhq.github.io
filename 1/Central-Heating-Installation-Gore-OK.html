<p>Scott Hauncher, a partner at Huron Capital, stated Pueblo tries to find more than just additional revenue or scale when it makes acquisitions - it looks for companies that can broaden Pueblo's customer base or offer a new line of services.

<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common mix used in vehicles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be acquired and utilized by qualified HVAC technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of people.<p>
