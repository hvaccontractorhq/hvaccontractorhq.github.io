<h3>Significance Of HVAC And Its Role in Kennard NE</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to return and fix the air conditioner. We had actually acquired the club member maintenance strategy, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any property buyers: hire Blue Flame to test the air conditioner before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam said he had ways to test AC systems even in winter. We wish we had actually understood him then.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most common blend utilized in cars in the U.S. till 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this type of application, however is still imported and can be purchased and utilized by licensed HVAC service technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by many individuals.<p>
