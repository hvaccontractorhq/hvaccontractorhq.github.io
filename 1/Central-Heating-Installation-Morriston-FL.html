Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has enjoyed the single-family home installation service entirely flip on its head the last few years. Winter season utilized to be the busy season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to three months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the environment and individuals." And not just with beginners more familiar with AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
