<h3>HVAC Repair And You What You Need to Understand in North Hollywood CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy expenses by improving airflow. After checking 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study found that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy performance. In many cases, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning however went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
