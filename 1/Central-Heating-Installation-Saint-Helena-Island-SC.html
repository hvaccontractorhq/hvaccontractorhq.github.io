<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost terrific but Mark headed out of his way to tailor a few things in my house to make the total air flow more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I have no doubt any future company associated to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>

Generally this leaves about 6% of incomes to the owner. For a company that generates $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This doesn't seem like much, particularly if the objective of owning a business was for financial freedom. Plus, this 6% wants the few years it required to build the business and not taking an income as the owner. However, this 6% usually isn't completion goal. HVAC company owner should strive for 10-15% by cutting costs in some locations or increasing their profits while keeping costs the exact same in all other locations.<p>
