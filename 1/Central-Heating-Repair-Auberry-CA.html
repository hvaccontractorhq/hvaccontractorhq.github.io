<p>The very first air conditioning unit and fridges employed toxic or flammable gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or propane, that might lead to deadly accidents when they dripped. Thomas Midgley, Jr. created the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).

<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either since of noticeable growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaky return ducts can likewise introduce wetness. Again, if you presume a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
