<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Because a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is quickly pierced.<p>
<p>A/c can also be offered by a procedure called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing free cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is included since the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, therefore declining its effectiveness.<p>
