<p>How environment modification affects air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost. This increase has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner need to increase its power usage by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is triggered, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The ac system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, hence making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
<p>The factor for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes sense to find the heat source at the flooring level. This lets the warmth naturally travel through the hot" zone, which is from an individual's toe to head area. All items in the hot zone reach equilibrium in temperature after the radiant heat system has actually been running for a while, consisting of individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace starts which sudden shot of coolness when it shuts off.<p>
