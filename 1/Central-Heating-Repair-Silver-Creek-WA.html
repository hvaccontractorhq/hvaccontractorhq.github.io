<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for assessment and help in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. During the 1970s, many house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy conservation step. Nevertheless, much of these houses were discovered to have reasonably high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, minimizing the performance of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>
