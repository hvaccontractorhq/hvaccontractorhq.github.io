<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally caused by the lack of appropriate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of contaminants from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the main problem in over half the workplace indoor air examinations it has conducted. Examinations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the exact same to be real. These examinations exposed that correct ventilation is essential in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, throat, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is likewise proof from animal studies that repeated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung illness such as emphysema. People at specific threat from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
