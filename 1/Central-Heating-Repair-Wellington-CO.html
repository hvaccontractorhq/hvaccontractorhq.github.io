<p>A stopped up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Filthy filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too blocked, the heat exchanger will shut and overheat off too rapidly, and your home will not heat up. If the blower is running but no heat is coming out, replace the filter. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
