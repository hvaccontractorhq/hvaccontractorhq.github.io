<p>How environment change impacts air quality and exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard modus operandi for modern-day a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioning unit boost.

As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the air conditioning unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The a/c unit's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
