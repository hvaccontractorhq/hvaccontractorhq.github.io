<p>Sean was extremely valuable. He is a really enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues besides the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only factor he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Lots of elements impact IAQ. These factors consist of poor ventilation (lack of outside air), issues managing temperature level, low or high humidity, current renovation, and other activities in or near a building that can affect the fresh air coming into the building.
