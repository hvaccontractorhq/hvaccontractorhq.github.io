<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise since 1978. If your a/c is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. If it leaks, simply adding refrigerant is not a service. An experienced technician ought to fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Remember that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioner is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the producer's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can likewise be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, in addition to all other types of heatpump, have performances rated according to their coefficient of performance, or POLICE OFFICER. It's a scientific way of determining just how much energy the system moves versus how much it uses. Most geothermal heatpump systems have Police officers of 3.0 to 5.0.
