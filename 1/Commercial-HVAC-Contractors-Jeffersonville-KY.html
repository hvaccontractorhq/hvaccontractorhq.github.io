<p>Luis was quickly responsive to email and texts with questions.

Protexs deal was among the couple of reasonable ones received. Others were almost twice the amount Protex priced estimate for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The install group was respectful of my house and set up the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment outcomes look great for braising and plumbing quality.

<h3>HVAC Contractors in Jeffersonville KY</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly and even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outside furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the location and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins.
