<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was friendly & well-informed throughout the visit. They suggested changing a few parts that were going out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search verified WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the go to or the new part. I was very happy they stood by their work and fixed the problem. Will definitely be using them once again.<p>
