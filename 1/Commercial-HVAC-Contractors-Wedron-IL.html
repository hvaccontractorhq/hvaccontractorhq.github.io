<p>Ducted heat pump cooling and heating systems act just like traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most affordable if your house or structure has an existing duct system that is in good shape. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
