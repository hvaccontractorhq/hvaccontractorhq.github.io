<p>People operating in buildings with poor IAQ might observe unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your doctor about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
<p>As mentioned above, triggering your new under tile flooring heating unit too soon, before the mortar has actually treated, can cause the grout to break or to not adhere appropriately, and might void the warranty of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile cracked when the system was run prior to the compound had actually cured. And mortar manufacturers may refuse service warranty protection if you do not follow their instructions.<p>
