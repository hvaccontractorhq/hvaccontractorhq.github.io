<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to check your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if totally iced over.<p>
