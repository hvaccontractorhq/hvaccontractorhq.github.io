<p>The majority of central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are used to distribute cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is running, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the a/c works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>The predominant health impact related to exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
