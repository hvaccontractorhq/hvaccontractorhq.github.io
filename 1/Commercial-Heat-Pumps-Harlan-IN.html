<h2>How To Hire Emergency HVAC Service in Harlan</h2>

This warmed air is then distributed about the house by a fan through ductwork" and distributed back in a cooler state by other ducts called cold-air returns." The procedure repeats itself and is turned on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or gas, but some are electrically powered also.<p>
<p>For example, problems emerge when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in sufficient quantities of outdoor air.
