<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money can be found in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use auto debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>
