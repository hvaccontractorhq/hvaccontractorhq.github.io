<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash coming in every month, it aids with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the sluggish times of the year. If we do decide to offer auto debit we would likewise have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There should not be any reason that your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
