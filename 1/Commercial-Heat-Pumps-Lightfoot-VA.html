<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace specialists often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on.

So he stated I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
