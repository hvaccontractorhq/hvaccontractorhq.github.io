<p>There is a transformer in your a/c furnace. The transformer is what supplies 24 volts to your Nest thermostat. If your transformer breakdowns, your Nest will not begin. Your transformer converts the high voltage to 24 volts. It then sends power to your typical wire or neutral, low voltage wire. There are emergency security changes that secure your a/c system from flooding. Among the most common places for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security switches is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. If your Nest is showing a blank screen, it is a great chance; you may have a water leak in the attic. The water activates your emergency safety switch, hence cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
