<h3>Air Conditioner Repair and Maintenance in Santa Rosa California</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He literally stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a couple of seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<h3>Working of an HVAC System in Santa Rosa CA</h3>
<p>The majority of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing pattern in home building and construction is to decrease air leak through fractures and other openings in roofs, walls, and floors. The mix of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has led to a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) advises that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for cosmetics air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh makeup air dilutes indoor contaminants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
