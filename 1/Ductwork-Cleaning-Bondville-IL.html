<p>Free cooling systems can have really high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be utilized for summertime a/c. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in since the storage acts as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>

Their techs are extremely experienced and expert. Costs are sensible. Always on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff set up a new air handler and condenser today. Since the cost was undoubtedly affordable, I did not bother to get competitor's quotes because of my trust in Waychoff.<p>
