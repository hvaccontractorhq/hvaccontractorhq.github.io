<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air issues by including new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) Nevertheless, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, wall, floor, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 2 days might end up being a source for mold growth and should be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy odor however mold can not be seen.

In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surfaces: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products including carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Fix the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the area utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
