The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the automobile debit, although my company does not offer auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year.
