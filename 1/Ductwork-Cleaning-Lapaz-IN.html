<p>Another technique to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants in your house is to increase the amount of outdoor air coming inside your home. The majority of house heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into the house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors get rid of pollutants straight from the room where the fan lies and likewise increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the room temperature level, and after that switch it ON. To prevent straining an air conditioning system's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outdoor compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
