<h3>The Most Common Reasons For Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a federal government company, conducted a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it decreases energy expenses by improving air flow. After evaluating 33 homes in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no significant improvement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not enhance air flow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, determined particle levels actually increased instantly after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
