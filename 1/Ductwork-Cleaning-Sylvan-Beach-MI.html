Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go tidy and outside off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've altered the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's excellent air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it.
