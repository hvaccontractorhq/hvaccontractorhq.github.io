<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then release the kept energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Protect the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
