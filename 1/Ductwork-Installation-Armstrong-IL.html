<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Right now, millions of allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, affecting the air you breathe along with the efficiency of your heating and air conditioning system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Just 9 percent of Americans consider it a threat to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a recent study by the Customer Reports National Research Center. But a lot of the important things people do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of airborne impurities in their homes and intensify asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Underfloor heating is easy to set up, especially if you make it part of a build or restoration project. For example, Warmup's StickyMat service can be set up as a Do It Yourself job as it is basic to lay down with the electric wire being all pre-spaced and easily connected to the mesh, all set to be rolled out in location.
