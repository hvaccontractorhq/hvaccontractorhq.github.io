<p>Free cooling systems can have extremely high performances, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer cooling. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (instead of charging) mode, triggering the temperature level to slowly increase during the cooling season.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your vehicle's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine components. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced routinely.
