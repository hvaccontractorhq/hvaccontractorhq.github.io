It sounds astounding, however furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that need to be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can cause a furnace to turn off. Filthy filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt limit air flow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up.

<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Even more recent heating systems less than 5 years old have been discovered as bad. A lot of house owners are stunned to find out that their 'brand-new' furnace has a cracked heat exchanger. In many cases it is because of bad furnace style, but in most cases, it's from overlook. Apotheosis Heating & House Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Examination of your furnace includes a System Analysis, which look for particles on the burners, bad air flow, and a dirty filter or blower, with cleaning and adjusting of the above as needed. The Efficiency Check-Up (see previous answer above) is likewise crucial to your furnace's life span.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be fulfilled without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
