<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system produces more difficulties, because a few of indoor systems can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space.
