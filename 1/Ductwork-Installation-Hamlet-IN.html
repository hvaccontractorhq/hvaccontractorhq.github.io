<p>Called WSE for a routine evaluation. The tech appeared right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the go to. They recommended changing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't inexpensive however a fast web search verified WSE wasn't pumping up prices, so I happily had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile hose pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>

<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may see unpleasant or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not going away or are becoming worse, speak with your physician about them. But not all direct exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for good building management.<p>
