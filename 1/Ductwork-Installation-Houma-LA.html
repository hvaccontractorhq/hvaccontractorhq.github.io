<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems in Houma LA</h3>
<p>Integrity Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various house efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took sufficient time to assist us debate which upgrades were cost reliable, which upgrades we might do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest cost savings. We never ever felt rushed and Taylor's technical knowledge of IES's products and services was impressive. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to a reasonable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while permitting me to perform the needed electrical enhancements to minimize cost.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally a lack of airflow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will gather on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is probably incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
