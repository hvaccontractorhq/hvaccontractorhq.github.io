HVAC experts advise following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the price of a new system, it's finest to buy new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
