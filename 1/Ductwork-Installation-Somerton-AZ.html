<p>Now, there are a few typical signs of a need for a/c repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioning system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
