<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, relatively stable over time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical material gradually. In reality, the true nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complex systems. Research study applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
