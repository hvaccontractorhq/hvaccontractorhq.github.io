Now the "difficult part" once a year turned off the electrical energy open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
