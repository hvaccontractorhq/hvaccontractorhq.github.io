<p>Wetness management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for most of the United States and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to offer thermal convenience inside your home. Nevertheless, high humidity outdoors creates the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture inside is associated with a higher occurrence of occupant breathing issues.<p>
