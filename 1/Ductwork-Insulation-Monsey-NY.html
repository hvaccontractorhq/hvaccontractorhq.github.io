These are normally of a light-weight gauze-like material, and must be changed or cleaned as conditions necessitate. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will require to have the filters changed regularly than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy expenses; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow.
