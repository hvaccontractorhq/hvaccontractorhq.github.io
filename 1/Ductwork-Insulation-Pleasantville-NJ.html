<h3>Gas Central Heating Systems in Pleasantville NJ - The Benefits</h3>
<p>The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it reduces energy costs by improving air flow. After checking 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study found that there was no considerable improvement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not enhance airflow or energy efficiency. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
