<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone diminishing HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that devices that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<p>Biological impurities include bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are many sources of these toxins. Pollens stem from plants; infections are sent by individuals and animals; germs are carried by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household family pets are sources of saliva and animal dander.
