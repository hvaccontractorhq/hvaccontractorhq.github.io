We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our pointer to any homebuyers: employ Blue Flame to evaluate the a/c before you buy. We bought this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, but Adam stated he had ways to check AC systems even in winter season. We wish we had known him then.<p>
