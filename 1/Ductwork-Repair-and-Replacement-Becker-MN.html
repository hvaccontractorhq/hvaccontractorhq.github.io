<p>. Before choosing the installation area of air conditioning system, several primary factors require to be thought about. First off, the direction of air circulation from the indoor units should not fall on the location of rest or workspace. Secondly, there ought to not be any obstacles en route of the airflow that might avoid it from covering the area of the premises as much as possible.
