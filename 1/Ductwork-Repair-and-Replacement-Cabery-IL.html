<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace professionals typically find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Search for a standard wall turn on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Since of our high standards for job quality and customer care, the majority of our clients concern us from recommendations - either personal recommendations from pals, or recommendations from contractors who rely on Bob's Heating & Air Conditioning and recommend us to new property owners.

<p>Combats the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably average, you can anticipate a minimum of one month throughout which temperature levels will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Simply a few years ago, Seattle saw a record temperature level of 103 degrees, and there have been lots of long, dry, hot streaks ever since. A central air system in your home means you have the power to adjust the temperature level to a constant temperature when the heat gets unbearable.<p>
