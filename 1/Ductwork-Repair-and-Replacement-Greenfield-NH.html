<p>A clogged furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut off. Dirty filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems. Dust and dirt restrict air flow-- and if the filter gets too clogged up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house will not warm up. Change the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A dirty filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, lowering the effectiveness of the furnace and reducing its life.<p>

<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Greenfield NH</h3>
<p>Elements that can add to the development of biological pollutants are wet or wet structure products (carpets, ceilings, walls) and inadequately preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a common health problem caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and persistent coughs. Various fungi and germs grow quickly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. During operation, these pollutants can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological contaminants are family pets and household plants.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without airflow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Switch off the AC system, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt again. If it still occurs, call the HVAC technician, due to the fact that something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
