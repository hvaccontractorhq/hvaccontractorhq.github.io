<p>Utilizing a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly lowers exposure to toxins during cooking. Inappropriate adjustment, often shown by a relentless yellow-tipped flame, causes increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you acquire a new gas stove or range, think about buying one with pilotless ignition since it does not have a pilot burner that burns continuously. Never ever use a gas stove to heat your house. Constantly make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in usage.<p>

Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost versatile pipe) instead of rigid square ducts. However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
