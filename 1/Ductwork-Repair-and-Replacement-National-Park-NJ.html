<h3>Geothermal Heat Pump in National Park NJ</h3>
<p>Ducted heatpump heating & cooling systems act much like standard central heating and cooling systems. The heat pump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces via a duct system.

Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of generating outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air outside. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
