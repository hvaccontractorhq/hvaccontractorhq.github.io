<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more severe cold. This is since ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
