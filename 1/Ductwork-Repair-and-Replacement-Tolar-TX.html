<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to compensate for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
