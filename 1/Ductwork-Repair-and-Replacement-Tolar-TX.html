<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is regularly in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps end up being inefficient in more severe cold. This is since ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air circulation over the coil.
