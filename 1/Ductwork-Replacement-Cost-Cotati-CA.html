<p>In a packaged central air conditioner, the evaporator, condenser, and compressor are all located in one cabinet, which normally is put on a roof or on a concrete slab beside your house's structure.

Air supply and return ducts come from inside your home through the house's exterior wall or roofing system to get in touch with the packaged a/c, which is usually situated outdoors.

<h3>The Operation of the Boiler Burner in Cotati CA</h3>
<p>So it ended up that whatever they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your financial investment by only using the services of a licensed contractor or a certified agent from a company or retailer to do the installation. If you choose to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed individual to do the work, in most, if not all cases, you will void the warranty for the a/c system. A voided warranty won't do you any great should the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the beginning and work with a licensed person with the experience to install the system.<p>
