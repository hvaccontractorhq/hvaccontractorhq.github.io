<p>We are OPEN as an "Necessary Service" throughout the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace technicians typically find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be switched on. Look for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace as well. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be fully depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Our professional technicians, in addition to being thoroughly trained, are TRUST CERTIFIED, meaning that they have passed a drug test, criminal background check, and driving record check.

<h3>The Way to Eradicate Boiler Problems in Dunstable MA</h3>
<p>Formaldehyde, a colorless, pungent-smelling gas, can trigger watery eyes, burning sensations in the eyes and throat, nausea, and problem in breathing in some humans exposed at elevated levels (above 0.1 parts per million). High concentrations might set off attacks in people with asthma. There is proof that some people can establish a sensitivity to formaldehyde. It has likewise been revealed to cause cancer in animals and may trigger cancer in people.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>

<p>Have utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have problems, they provide me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never ever try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
