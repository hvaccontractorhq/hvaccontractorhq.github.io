<h3>The Way to Prevent Costly HVAC Emergency Service Calls in Junction City WI</h3>
<p>Many residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in house building and construction is to minimize air leak through cracks and other openings in walls, roofings, and floorings. The mix of these building practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually led to a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside make-up air per minute (CFM) per person be brought into the indoor living locations of residential buildings. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh makeup air assists and dilutes indoor pollutants tire them from the home.<p>
