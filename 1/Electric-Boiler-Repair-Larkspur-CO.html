<h3>Air Conditioner Parts in Larkspur Colorado</h3>
<p>If no impurity sources are discovered, it is still possible that an indoor air pollution issue exists. Excessive re-circulation of air leads to "stale air" conditions. Stale air has higher levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas (produced from human breathing and cigarette smoke, respectively) than outdoors air. Stagnant air might also be a problem when ventilation is not adequate to represent a boost in the variety of workers in the location.<p>
<p>Speaking of air, radiant heat systems tend to improve indoor air quality. This is because forced air heating systems distribute airborne pollutants throughout the house throughout operation, provoking a range of different unfavorable results. Radiant heating systems don't distribute air at all, which really enhances your indoor air quality by restricting your exposure to high levels of air-borne contaminants.<p>
<p>It is not advised that "regular" occupational exposure limits (e.g., OELs, TLVs ®, PELs) be used to identify if the basic indoor air quality satisfies a specific standard. Occupational direct exposure limits listed in health and safety regulations and the Threshold Limitation Values ® (TLVs) advised by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are intended as a guide to avoid health problem or certain effects (like eye and nose irritation) in commercial circumstances. These limits may not be proper in workplace settings or for the home.<p>

<h3>Residential HVAC Contractors in Larkspur CO</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might think. Since most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend using "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>
