The refrigerant names consist of a number indicating the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most used in direct-expansion home and building convenience cooling is an HCFC referred to as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The primary route of direct exposure is through the creation of an aerosol effect, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A common source of Legionella in commercial structures is from badly put or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might get in neighboring ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical centers and retirement home, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has included outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The presence of Legionella in commercial building water materials is extremely under-reported, as healthy individuals need heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
