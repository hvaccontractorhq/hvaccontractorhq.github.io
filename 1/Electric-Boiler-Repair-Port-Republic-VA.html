<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater because the technicians thought they just didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
