<p>We're spending a lot more time inside your home, these days. While lots of people presume pollution is simply an outdoor issue, your home (and office) can also be polluted. As a society, we make certain that our homes are well-insulated and well-sealed, but we don't think sufficient about exposure to all the things we place in our homes," says Susan Olesik, PhD, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The air quality within and around structures and structures has a huge effect on your health, and while you can feel the signs-- shortness of breath, dizziness, queasiness-- right now, they can begin years after exposure, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and banned using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned making use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that devices that uses R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now prohibited, systems that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
