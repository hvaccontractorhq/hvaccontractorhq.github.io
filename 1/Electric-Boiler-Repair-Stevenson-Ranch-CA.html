<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This suggests that equipment that utilizes R22 can still run, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, systems that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and preserved.<p>
