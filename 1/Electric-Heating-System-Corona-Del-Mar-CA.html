One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then circulated through a piping system under the floor surface area. The second is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the flooring are forced to resist current, which then creates heat.<p>
