<p>A/c can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can often release contaminants.) However, procedures such as installing storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air infiltrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
