<p>Now, there are a few typical indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you should examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
