<h3>Boiler Maintenance in Onalaska WA - Reasons Why You Would Have to Reset The Boiler</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% evaluation, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>Current Evaluation: I am extremely happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was great. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to describe everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was respectful and educated. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
