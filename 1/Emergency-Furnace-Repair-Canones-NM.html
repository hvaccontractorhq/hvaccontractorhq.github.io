<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning system works however your house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile tube) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it does not stand well to tear and wear and is easily punctured.<p>

They sold her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, despite the fact that it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
