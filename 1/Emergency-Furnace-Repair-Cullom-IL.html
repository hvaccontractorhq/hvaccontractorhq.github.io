A building walk-through to check for odors and search for water damage, leakages, dirt or insect droppings might be handy. Leakages require to be eliminated. Standing water in humidifiers, a/c units, on roofs and in boiler pans can end up being contaminated with bacteria or fungis and need to be removed, also.
