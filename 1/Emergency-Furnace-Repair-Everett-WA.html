Their techs are very knowledgeable and professional. Costs are reasonable. Constantly on time, and call when they are on their way. Waychoff installed a brand-new air handler and condenser today.

For systems requiring only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by lots of individuals.<p>
