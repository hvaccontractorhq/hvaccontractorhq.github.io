<p>The quality of the air inside our schools, offices and houses matters, especially considering that we invest the majority of our lives inside your home. Air conditioners help to dehumidify the incoming air, however in very humid environments or in cases where the air conditioning system is oversized, it might not achieve a low humidity. Running a dehumidifier in your air conditioned house will increase your energy use, both for the dehumidifier itself and due to the fact that the air conditioning system will need more energy to cool your house. A more effective option is a dehumidifying heat pipeline, which can be added as a retrofit to most existing systems.<p>
