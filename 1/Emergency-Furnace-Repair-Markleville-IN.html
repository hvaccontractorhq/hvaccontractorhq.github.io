<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a home's forced-air distribution system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork utilized for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the a/c system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the a/c works but your house doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
