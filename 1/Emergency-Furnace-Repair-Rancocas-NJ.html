<p>We look at clues before we offer recommendations to replace instead of repair a heater. Among the clues we take a look at is the cost of energy. If energy costs are high compared to use, or if energy costs are higher every year, we understand the system is not running effectively. It may be in ideal condition, but if it costs you more in a year to run than it would cost to replace it with a more effective model, then you would be losing money by not replacing the older system.<p>
