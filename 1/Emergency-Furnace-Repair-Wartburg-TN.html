<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to provide your house that perfect temperature level all year round. However while they're cycling through all that air, they're straining some of those typical air contaminants. Eventually, their air filters fill and stop doing their task.

So, be sure to change your AC filters frequently, or get a cooling service plan which typically consists of a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a metropolitan area with high levels of contamination.<p>
