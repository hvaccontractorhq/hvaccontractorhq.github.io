<p>We tend to consider air pollution as something outside - smog, haze, or ozone hanging in the air, particularly in summer season. Connection concerns along the line that supplies power to your furnace can jeopardize the efficiency of the system. Loose, missing or faulty wires will trigger the thermostat to lose its connection to the system and interrupt service. Part of maintaining your furnace includes inspecting the recommended connections along with temperature level and pressure gauges. Take some time to inspect these parts for dust and damage, making sure that they are protected and tight.<p>
<p>Apartments can have the same indoor air problems as single-family houses because much of the contamination sources, such as the interior structure products, furnishings, and household items, are similar.
