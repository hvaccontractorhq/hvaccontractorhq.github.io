<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the two specialists I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your house's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house.

From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is normally routed into a basement flooring drain, energy sink, or outdoors.<p>
