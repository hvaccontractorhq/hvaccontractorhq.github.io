<p>How environment change affects air quality and exposure to air contaminants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c) requires that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioning system boost. This boost has the impact that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system removes that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating aspect cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
