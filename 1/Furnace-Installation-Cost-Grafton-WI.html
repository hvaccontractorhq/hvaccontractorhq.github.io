<h3>HVAC Services Company in Grafton Wisconsin</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The system runs silently and effectively, but to have 2 significant components stop working in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant reliability. An F" for $616 in labor costs (defrost control panel installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the invoice before work started. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was finished in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Excellent Item! Delivery was sort of weird being that the box was opened and products might have fell out. But after evaluation of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was extremely lite weight and takes some time to use. Note: buy advised non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make certain to watch the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting assistance, we fixed problems. I would suggest this product to anyone who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
