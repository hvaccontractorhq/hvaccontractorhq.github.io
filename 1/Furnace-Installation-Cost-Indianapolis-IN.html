<h3>The Fundamentals of Central Heating and Air Conditioning in Indianapolis IN</h3>
<p>Sun Ray Solar water heating systems need fairly little attention. However, just like any mechanical system, some basic maintenance is vital to keep the system working efficiently. The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heater are similar to those of conventional water heaters. The collectors, piping and storage tank need to be looked for leaks, the system needs to be flushed occasionally to get rid of tank and gathered impurities (scaling in hard water areas). The systems should be inspected a minimum of twice each year for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensors. The collector's glass can be rinsed regularly to get rid of dust gathered in order to improve collector effectiveness.<p>
<p>Both need to be kept tidy because an air conditioner moves heat in between the outdoor coil and the indoor coil. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in damage to the compressor, due to the fact that the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat created by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
