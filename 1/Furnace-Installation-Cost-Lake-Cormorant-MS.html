Lots of common structure materials used prior to 1975 consist of asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heater, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation products. Typically, substantial releases of asbestos fiber do not happen unless the structure products are disrupted, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or structure renovation.

<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of examining the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be calibrated regularly, and outside measurements utilized for calculations must be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
<p>Air pollutants can vary from impurities brought in from the outdoors by your family pets to unsafe gas leakages.
