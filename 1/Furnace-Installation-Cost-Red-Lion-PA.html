<p>To state there are a lot of variables in setting up solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its original box, using the dense-foam packing product to secure it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware items in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry place for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete flooring, place 2 2x4s below package to raise it up and safeguard it from moisture.<p>
<p>The life-span of a central air system is considered to be 15-20 years, and today's a/c are more energy effective than designs made even 5 years earlier, so it makes monetary sense to replace or update your system if it's five years old or older. The best central air conditioning conditioner you can buy today will utilize 30-50% less energy than one purchased in 1975 while delivering the same amount of cooling.<p>
