<p>Factors that can add to the development of biological pollutants are wet or damp building products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and improperly kept humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and air conditioning unit. "Humidifier fever" is a common illness caused by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and consistent coughs. Different fungis and bacteria grow rapidly in the warm, stagnant water inside humidifiers. Throughout operation, these impurities can be distributed into the air and inhaled by the building occupants. Other possible sources of biological impurities are family pets and family plants.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your air conditioning system and heatpump need to be devoid of all blockages and particles. Obstructions can obstruct the circulation of condensed water and cause wetness accumulation within the system. Excess wetness can trigger issues like mold, water damage, high levels of humidity in the home, unequal temperature policy, germs, and jeopardized air quality. An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to make sure all excess moisture streams far from the system.<p>
