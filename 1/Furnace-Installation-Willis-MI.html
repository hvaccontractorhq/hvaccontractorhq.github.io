<p>As much of you mentioned, preventative maintenance is required by all major devices producer's to guarantee your factory guarantees stay in place. Additionally, the tangible results of a PM is typically tough to quantify, as one response specified the cost savings in effectiveness or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or air conditioning system do not simply break at the breeze of a finger, but instead is the result of repeated use of a part that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working prematurely due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, preparing the metal and triggering premature wear and tear, causing holes and cracks. If that client had actually gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the part.  a very helpful result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that possibly saved a client thousands.<p>
