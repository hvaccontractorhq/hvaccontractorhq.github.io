<p>Mark (owner) and team were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. As soon as I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was said and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my house to make the total air circulation more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future service associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs operating HVAC systems as designed. Moisture management and humidity control may contravene efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to save energy. For instance, moisture management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide make-up air at lower temperatures (style levels), rather of the higher temperature levels often utilized to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for most of the United States and many parts of Europe and Japan, during the majority of hours of the year, outdoor air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to supply thermal comfort inside your home.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two professionals I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
