<p>We tend to consider air contamination as something outside - haze, ozone, or smog hanging in the air, specifically in summertime. These convection heaters are still commonly utilized and are typically called forced-air systems"-- where there's a central heating component in the furnace throughout which air is blown.

Overall, they cost in between $2,000 and $8,000 to install. Overall, they supply an AFUE score of between 80 and 90 percent.<p>
