Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts.

The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
