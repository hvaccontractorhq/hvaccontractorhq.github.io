<p>The term radiant heat covers a couple of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes connected to terminal systems like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
