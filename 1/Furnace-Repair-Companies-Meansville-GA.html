<p>SysTech Style concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment. The very same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it distributes through your home. Condensed moisture can cause dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
