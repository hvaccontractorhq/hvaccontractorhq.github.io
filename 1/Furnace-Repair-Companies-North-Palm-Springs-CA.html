The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it flows through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils.

It likewise prevents water from accumulating on and below the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
