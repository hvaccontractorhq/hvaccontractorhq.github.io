Secondly like prolonged auto service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely made the most of. A lot of companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to effectively service and the unit has been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
