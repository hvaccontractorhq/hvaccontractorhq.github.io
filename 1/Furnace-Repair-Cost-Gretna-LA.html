<h3>Gas Central Heating in Gretna LA</h3>

It can also increase your heating bills and impact your household's health.

<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes give off toxins.) However, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can minimize the quantity of outside air infiltrating into a house. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>On the interior, warm, humid air from your home's interior is blown through the evaporator coil. The cold coil takes in heat from the air, cooling it, before the air is circulated back into your house. The humidity in the air condenses on the cool surface of the evaporator coil as liquid water, leaking into a pan listed below. From the pan, the water streams into a drain tube which is typically routed into a basement flooring drain, utility sink, or outdoors.<p>
