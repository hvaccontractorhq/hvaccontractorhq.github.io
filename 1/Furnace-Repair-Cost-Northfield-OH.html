<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after a prolonged duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a reasonable sign of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine co2 need to be calibrated frequently, and outdoor measurements used for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors might also be essential.<p>
