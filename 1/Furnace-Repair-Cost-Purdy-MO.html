After 2 years, things began to change. There have been awkward noises. I got it repaired and checked. I am hoping that is the end of the issue. Overall, it has actually been a good experience. Dependable on the whole. Cool operation and great cooling system. Yes, I was not delighted with its looks in the start. However then realized Air conditioners are for cooling and not for beautification.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I saw I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it very rapidly. However here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>
