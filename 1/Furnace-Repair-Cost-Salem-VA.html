<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise considering that 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power must not surpass the capacity of the outdoor unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems higher than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. Nevertheless, it is wrong to anticipate better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the exact same time, given that the overall capability of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outdoor system. Basically, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a way that some of the spaces may not have an extremely comfy temperature level. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total power is not basic, considering that it considers not only the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>The primary problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While setting up a different split system, workers attempt to find both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Setting up a multi-split system creates more problems, considering that some of indoor systems can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not permit you to set the air conditioning separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional characteristics of indoor units operate individually from each other.<p>
