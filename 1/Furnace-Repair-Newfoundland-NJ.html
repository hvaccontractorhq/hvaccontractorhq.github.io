<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with questions.

Others were nearly twice the quantity Protex priced quote for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately encouraged me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more cash (Sincerity) The install team was considerate of my home and installed the equipment in the anticipated amount of time. post set up assessment results look very good for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 heap R22 system it replaced (likewise Provider).<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe twice a year and clear out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and extremely thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, do not touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
