<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives requests for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal firms. The likelihood of instant responses to indoor air toxins depends on several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions.

<p>A ducted heatpump looks like a large central air conditioner system that sits outside your house. Heatpump run on electrical energy and work like a/c unit in reverse, utilizing a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outdoor air.

Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later utilizing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in because the storage functions as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, causing the temperature level to gradually increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
