<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Port Hueneme Cbc Base CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, carried out a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by enhancing airflow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels in fact increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased instantly after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that an air conditioning unit moves heat in between the indoor coil and the outdoor coil, both need to be kept clean. This means that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to regularly clean up the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser tidy will ultimately lead to harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
