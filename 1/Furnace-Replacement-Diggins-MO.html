<p>While radon in water is not an issue in houses served by most public water products, it has been discovered in well water. If you have actually checked the air in your house and found a radon problem, and you have a well, call a laboratory certified to determine radiation in water to have your water checked. Radon issues in water can be easily fixed. Call your state radon workplace or the EPA Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more details.<p>
<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have actually been shown to cause the health effects pointed out.

Fortunately is that the one major disadvantage of heatpump is that they can fail in the cold or very hot temperatures, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound location.<p>
