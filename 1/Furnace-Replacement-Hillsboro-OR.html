<p>The effects of lead exposure on fetuses and young children can be severe. They consist of hold-ups in psychological and physical development, lower IQ levels, shortened attention periods, and increased behavioral issues. Kids, fetuses, and babies are more susceptible to lead exposure than grownups because lead is more quickly absorbed into growing bodies, and the tissues of small children are more sensitive to the harmful effects of lead. Children might have greater direct exposures because they are most likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
