<p>Ron, the owner, reached out to me relating to an unusually high expense that I got blindsided by BEFORE he understood that I had actually called the service supervisor and left a message of issue. Ron had spotted the problem area in examining the bill. He resolved the issue in one day, had changed the bill to what I thought about reasonable before he recalled, understood what might have triggered the issue and had a plan to insure that it would not happen again.

The team showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and finished a little early. The likewise promptly followed up with the needed inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly suggest this company.<p>
