<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional job locating the outside unit as close to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

EPA's pamphlet, Residential Air-Cleaning Devices, offers further details on air-cleaning devices to reduce indoor air toxins.<p>
