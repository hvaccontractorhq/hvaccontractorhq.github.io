"the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Lot system and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the price terrific however Mark headed out of his method to personalize a couple of things in my house to make the overall air flow more enhanced. I believe it actually only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my unit set up. I believe any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that many ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible pipe) rather of stiff square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
