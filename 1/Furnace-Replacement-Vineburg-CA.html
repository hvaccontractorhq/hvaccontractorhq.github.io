<p>A/c can also be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is included because the temperature of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
