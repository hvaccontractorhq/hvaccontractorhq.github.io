<h3>The Most Common Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise homes bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has actually seen the single-family house installation service completely turn on its head the last few years. Winter season used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times swelling to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with beginners more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle property owners are finally giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in vehicles in the U.S. till 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC technicians. For systems needing just an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in excellent working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by lots of people.<p>

<p>Watch out for signs of water leakages or flooding to stop mold from growing. Permeable materials, flooring, ceiling, and wall coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and should be disposed of. Often there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in covert or hardly ever accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on flooring products including carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the wetness problem, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
