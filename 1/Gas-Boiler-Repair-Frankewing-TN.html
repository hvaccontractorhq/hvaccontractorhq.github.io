Set up a valve in this pipe (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the traditional water heater are open, water will stream from the solar storage tank to the standard water heater (normal operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will stream from the solar storage tank past the standard water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summertime when water temperatures are high, and the conventional hot water heater can be turned off entirely.<p>
<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, including electric heating units and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heat systems run on comparable concepts.

In the case of electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
