However, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the very same time, since the total capacity of the whole system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Put simply, the outdoor unit will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the rooms might not have a very comfortable temperature level.
