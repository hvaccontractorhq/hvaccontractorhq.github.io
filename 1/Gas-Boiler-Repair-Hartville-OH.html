<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts.
