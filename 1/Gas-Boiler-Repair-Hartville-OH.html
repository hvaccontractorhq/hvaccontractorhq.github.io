<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
