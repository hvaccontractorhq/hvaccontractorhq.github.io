What made me opt for this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will suggest this company to my pals.<p>

First of all, the instructions of air flow from the indoor units should not fall on the location of rest or workspace.
