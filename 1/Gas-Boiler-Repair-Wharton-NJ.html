<p>Unpredictable organic compounds (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside your home consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a new carpet is likely to be emitting formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outdoors might include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
<p>Legionellosis or Legionnaire's Disease is brought on by a waterborne bacterium Legionella that grows best in slow-moving or still, warm water. The main path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol effect, many commonly from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which frequently release water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation intakes. Outbreaks in medical centers and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people need heavy exposure to acquire infection.<p>
