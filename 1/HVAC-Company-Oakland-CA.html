It might be in ideal condition, however if it costs you more in a year to operate than it would cost to change it with a more efficient design, then you would be squandering money by not replacing the older system.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit pollutants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
