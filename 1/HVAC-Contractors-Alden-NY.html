<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, affordable flexible hose) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
