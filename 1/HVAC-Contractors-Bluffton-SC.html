<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty smell consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much excellent if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and examine.
