<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff regularly receives ask for consultation and support in resolving indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, numerous homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation measure. Nevertheless, much of these homes were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Couple of homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<p>Fact: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment typically lasts years, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical guidelines eliminate the problem of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it indefinitely. In the past, some improperly sized systems did overcool the ground or overheat over time, to the point that the system no longer had sufficient of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
