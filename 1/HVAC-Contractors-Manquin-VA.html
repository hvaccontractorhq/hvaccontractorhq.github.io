<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often receives requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation measure. However, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, homes in which UFFI was set up many years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
