<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might require a reference in the future). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp adapters should snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Get rid of the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you have actually swapped all the wires.<p>
