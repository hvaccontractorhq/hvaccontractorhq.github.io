<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor-free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema.

<p>A third method to decide whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find indications of issues with the ventilation in your home. Indications that can indicate your home might not have sufficient ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or foul-smelling air, unclean central heating and air cooling equipment, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become moldy.

<p>Evaporative coolers tend to feel as if they are not working throughout times of high humidity, when there is very little dry air with which the coolers can work to make the air as cool as possible for house residents.
