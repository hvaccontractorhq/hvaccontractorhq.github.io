<p>Ventilation plays an important role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of procedures which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the structure, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these processes are underperforming.<p>
