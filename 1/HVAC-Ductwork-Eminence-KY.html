<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Purchased a new primary unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged service warranties or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great financial investment in my viewpoint. Never try to offer me something I do not need.<p>
