<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit many companies do so they can have a known amount of cash can be found in each month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There must not be any reason why your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>

<h3>Why You Need Air Conditioning Repair in Memphis TN?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'cars and truck oil change' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
