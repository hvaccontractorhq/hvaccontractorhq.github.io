<p>If the hvac company didn't come out ahead they would not offer agreements.  The so called trustworthy companies rip off more people than the fly by night outfits. Since I attempted to work for them, I know. Due to the fact that 90% of them are scoundrels, I give up. They walk in with or without an agreement and begin selling you things you don't need.
