This is because ice kinds on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
