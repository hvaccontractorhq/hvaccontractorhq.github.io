<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it absorbs heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, resulting in cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Consider potential results of indoor air pollution if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas space heating unit. Follow the maker's instructions, especially instructions on the appropriate fuel and keeping the heater appropriately changed. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is generally an indicator of maladjustment and increased contaminant emissions.
