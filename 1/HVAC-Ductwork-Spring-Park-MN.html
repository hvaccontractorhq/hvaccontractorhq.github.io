<p>Heating is the biggest energy expense in the average home. In extremely dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases described as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness throughout hot weather.

The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is lowered. The temperature level of the incoming air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (reasonable heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the reasonable heat of the getting in air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather significant if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
