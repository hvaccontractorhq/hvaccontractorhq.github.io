<p>It is common to assume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of material in a building as fairly unchanged physical material with time. In reality, the real nature of structures can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and comprehended as intricate systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
