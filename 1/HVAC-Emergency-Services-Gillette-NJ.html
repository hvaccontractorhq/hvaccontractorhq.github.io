<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors considerably decreases direct exposure to toxins during cooking. Improper adjustment, typically indicated by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased toxin emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you buy a brand-new gas range or variety, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continuously. Never ever use a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in usage, always make certain the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
