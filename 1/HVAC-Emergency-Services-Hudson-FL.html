<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. When I decided to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the price great but Mark went out of his way to customize a couple of things in my house to make the general air flow more optimized.

<h3>Ducted Air Conditioning Prices in Hudson Florida</h3>
<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy odor regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and examine.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
