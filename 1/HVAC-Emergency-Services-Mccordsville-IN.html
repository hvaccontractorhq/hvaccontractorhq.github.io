The maintenance requirements of Sun Ray Solar water heating system resemble those of conventional hot water heater.

The systems must be inspected at least twice annually for a correct operation of the pump, controller and sensing units.

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a structure as relatively the same physical product gradually. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the developed environment considering the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
