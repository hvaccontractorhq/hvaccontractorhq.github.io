<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We frequently see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly the same physical product in time.

Buildings can be explained and understood as complicated systems. Research applying the methods ecologists use to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
