<p>Airflow patterns in building are identified by the combined forces of mechanical ventilation systems, human activity, and natural results. Atmospheric pressure differences produced by these forces move airborne contaminants from locations of greater pressure to areas of lower pressure through any readily available opening in building walls, ceilings, floors, doors, windows, and HVAC systems. Even if the opening is little, air will move till the inside pressure is equal to the exterior.<p>
<p>EPA's Overall Direct exposure Assessment Method (TEAM) studies discovered levels of about a dozen typical natural contaminants to be 2 to 5 times higher inside homes than outdoors, no matter whether the houses were found in extremely commercial or rural locations. Extra GROUP research studies suggest that while people are using products containing organic chemicals, they can expose themselves and others to extremely high contaminant levels, and elevated concentrations can continue the air long after the activity is completed.<p>
