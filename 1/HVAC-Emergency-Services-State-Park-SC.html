<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an excellent task locating the outside system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The job took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to guarantee the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>In a common residential HVAC company, the owner pays most of every dollar earned to his staff members, devices expenses, marketing, energies, and other expenses before paying himself anything. Generally this leaves about 6% of earnings to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take house pay. This does not sound like much, particularly if the goal of owning an organisation was for financial flexibility. Plus, this 6% seeks the couple of years it required to build business and not taking an earnings as the owner. Nevertheless, this 6% generally isn't the end goal.
