The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not permit you to set the cooling separately for each room.

<p>Cooling can likewise be provided by a process called complimentary cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heatpump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases during the cooling season, therefore decreasing its efficiency.<p>
<p>People working in buildings with poor IAQ may discover musty or undesirable smells or may feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that happen at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not going away or are becoming worse, talk with your doctor about them. However not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no replacement for good structure management.<p>

It's possible that the size of AC unit you have is not huge enough for your home. It will have to work harder and might get too hot if the system is too small. Typically, an HVAC system costs $4,820 to $9,350 to install a 5-ton system for a 2,000- to 3,000-square-foot home.<p>
