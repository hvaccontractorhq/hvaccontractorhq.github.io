<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply today I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the exact same day. He understood just what the issue was and fixed it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole a/c and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to determine it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>In addition to getting the huge image" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality screen can be set up to supply threshold signals. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your tracking equipment to inform you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached critical point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to solve the situation immediately.<p>
<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and feline saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; germs are carried by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can end up being air-borne. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological pollutants and can then distribute these contaminants through the home.<p>
