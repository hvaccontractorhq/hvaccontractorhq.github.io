<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Properly maintained heating equipment can last for many years. But if you're experiencing regular breakdowns or your fuel bills unexpectedly appear higher than normal, it is most likely time to think about a new system.

A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
