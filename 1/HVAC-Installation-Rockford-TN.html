<p>And it's not simply downtown high- and mid-rise apartment or condos bringing AC to Seattle. Jamey Stephens of Evergreen Home Heating and Energy has actually viewed the single-family house installation business entirely turn on its head the last couple of years. Winter used to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summer, with their generally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to up to 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," says Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not just with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Long time Seattle homeowners are lastly giving up, he states, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
<p>Examine these 3 things initially if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the registers in your house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is tidy Then go outside and tidy off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The lowered airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged. If you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for at least 30 minutes or till there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
