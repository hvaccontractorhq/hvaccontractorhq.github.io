<p>Since it's the most typical heating system in Seattle homes, I'll begin with a natural gas furnace. Warm air is delivered to the rooms of your house by means of ducts, and cool air is gathered by means of cold air return vents. Gas heaters are ranked for effectiveness. Older systems from the 1970s may be rated 65%, meaning 35% of the heating energy is wasted throughout the combustion process. Today's models range from a minimum of 78% as much as 98.5%. If your home currently has ducts, replacing your heating system with a new, effective gas furnace is a fairly straightforward process. Installing a new gas furnace system can be quite expensive if you are adding on to your house or retrofitting a house without ducting.<p>
