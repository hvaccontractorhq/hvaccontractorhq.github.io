<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts.
