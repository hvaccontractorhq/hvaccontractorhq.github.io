<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of unusual being that the box was opened and items could have fell out. However after review of contents we guaranteed it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: buy suggested non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as suggested to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make certain to enjoy the video first prior to installation and follow all directions specifically. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.

<h3>Ventilation System in Clearlake CA</h3>
<p>I generally do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other choice. What made me go with this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and talk about choices. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>An indoor air contaminant is a compound in the air that may affect the health of people who live in the home. Toxins might originate from outside the house-- such as an idling automobile engine in a connected garage, backyard trash burning, or radon going into your house from the ground below. An air contaminant could also come from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, unstable natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted space, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or damp carpeting, or chemicals from hobbies, household cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, pet dander, and bug parts (allergen or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>Next, and perhaps just as important when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too large will have a simple time keeping the home cool, but will have a harder time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, a system that is too little will not be able to properly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger systems cost more than smaller units, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air system needs to hold.<p>
