<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. Initially, you must check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally decrease the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
