That's because it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy required to offer a specific cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER.

However, pick your contractor sensibly, a number of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales strategies that DO benefit from uninformed homeowners. Once again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with a program. While Angie's list is a great base line sign that you MIGHT be working with a respectable company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar rating are the very same). There is a wealth of consumer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant arrived on time. Jose hung around fixing the issue, all the while discussing everything to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working appropriately. He needed to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly utilize Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
