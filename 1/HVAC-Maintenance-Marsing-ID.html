Nevertheless, many of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up many years ago are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
