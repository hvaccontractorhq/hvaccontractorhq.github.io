<p>Some cooling systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise frequently referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heatpump is significantly more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heat pump remains in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes functions and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat.
