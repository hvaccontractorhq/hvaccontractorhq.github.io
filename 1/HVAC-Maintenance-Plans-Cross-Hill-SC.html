<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, many Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC system is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outdoors unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a great idea of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is filthy, you remain in luck, that's most likely your problem.

The easiest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the system off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is frequently in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is since ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heatpump system need to briefly change back into the regular cooling mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
