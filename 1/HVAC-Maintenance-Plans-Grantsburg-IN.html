<p>WE ARE LIKEWISE PROVIDING NON-CONTACT AND VIRTUAL CONVENIENCE ASSESSMENTS. Bypass valve: Run a pipeline between the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater. Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard hot water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional hot water heater (regular operation). If the valves on the pipes going into and the pipes leaving the traditional hot water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the traditional hot water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer season when water temperature levels are high, and the standard water heater can be turned off totally.<p>

<p>I have had the satisfaction of working with Pro-Staff Mechanical, Inc. for practically 10 years and throughout that time, they have actually always offered excellent service.

<p>I had a terrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for setting up a furnace cost $1,300. Moreover, the company used 98% of the existing product purchased with your home. This company introduced a service arrangement contract to offer service to heating, electrical and plumbing. Throughout the inspection on an extremely cold day they killed the furnace declaring health hazard factor and contractor laws for their decision. As a brand-new homeowner I have actually found out how to determine the truthful HVAC company vs the HVAC snakes.<p>

<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's provided a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
