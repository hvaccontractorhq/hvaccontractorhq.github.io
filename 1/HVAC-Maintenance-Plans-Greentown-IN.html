<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have been around given that the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a warm water supply. Romans utilized a wood-fired boiler tended by slaves and a primary pumping device to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floors. In turn, the uniformity of the flooring heat transferred heat to other short articles in the spaces, consisting of the human residents.<p>
<p>More common in reasonably older houses, a boiler-based heating system uses gas, oil or electricity to heat water and produce steam that moves through pipelines to heat radiators in specific spaces. All-electric boilers can attain up to 95 to 100 percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must attain 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers need to accomplish a 75 percent AFUE.<p>

<p>If you believe a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of noticeable development or a musty odor consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can check and maintain. Leaky return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>
