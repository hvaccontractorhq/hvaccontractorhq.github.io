<p>To say there are a great deal of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Location the a/c unit back into its original box, using the dense-foam packaging material to protect it from damage. Put all the screws, brackets and other installation hardware products in a re-sealable plastic bag, and put the bag in package. Set the box in a cool, dry location for the winter season. And if the storage room has a concrete floor, place two 2x4s beneath package to raise it up and protect it from wetness.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a recommendation later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
