<p>We called Elite HEATING AND COOLING on among the hottest days of summer season( we had no central air conditioning for 2weeks) and they sent some1 out same day to assess situation & chose to go with them for the work. I am happy to state that not just did we get the central air going but likewise changed the heating unit which was old. Everybody we spoke to from beginning to end were really expert, considerate and the work was extremely efficiently done. I would highly advise this company.<p>
<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have given an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity expert at a big retailer who asked not to be named because he did not have approval to speak on the record, it is common for big retail operations to have a group that regularly keeps an eye on energy usage and temperatures in shops to save money on expenses (especially during the night) and to alert shop managers if temperature levels in the shops fluctuate outside of an appropriate range that might avoid consumers from shopping at the store.<p>
<p>Air contaminants can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leaks.
