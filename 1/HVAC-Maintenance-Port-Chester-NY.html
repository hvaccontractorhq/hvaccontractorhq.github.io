Service technicians are often required to work in confined locations, on high ladders near ceilings, or on the roofs of homes. They can be exposed to undesirable weather for long periods of time.

<p>For example, issues arise when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not utilized to bring in sufficient quantities of outdoor air. Inadequate ventilation also occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are obstructed or positioned in such a method that outdoor air does not really reach the breathing zone of structure residents. Incorrectly situated outside air intake vents can also generate air contaminated with vehicle and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from washrooms.
