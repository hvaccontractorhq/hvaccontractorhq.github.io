<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in top condition for the ac system to work well. This includes the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which reside inside the home.

In addition, the large boosts in ventilation it requires to considerably decrease direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke can also increase energy costs considerably. Subsequently, the most reliable way to reduce direct exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the home is to get rid of smoking there.<p>

Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet.

However avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to use and tear and is quickly pierced.<p>
