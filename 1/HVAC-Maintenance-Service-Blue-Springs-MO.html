<p>When your Volvo no longer keeps you cool- give All Vovo a call! Heatpump work very well in temperate environments like King and South Snohomish counties. Operating on electrical energy, a heatpump is an affordable option utilizing a refrigeration cycle like that which cools your fridge, but in reverse. Instead of warming or cooling the air currently inside your home, it draws heat or cool from the air outside and pushes it through the ventilation system of your home.<p>
<p>When filters aren't changed or cleaned up frequently, they can end up being clogged with particles that can restrict airflow, possibly impacting your convenience and your system's performance. Filthy filters can cause extra wear and tear on furnace parts and in more severe cases cause the system to close down entirely. By contrast, checking and replacing a furnace filter can normally be done in simply a couple of minutes, typically with no tools needed. As a safety measure, before cleaning your furnace filter, be sure to turn off the furnace either at the thermostat or utilizing the power switch, typically installed on the side of the furnace.<p>
