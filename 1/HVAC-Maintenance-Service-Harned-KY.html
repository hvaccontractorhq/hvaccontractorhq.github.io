<h3>HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) Principles in Harned KY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was really clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>An undersize system will not be able to cool spaces down entirely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to run since it just takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And a large-scale system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has an opportunity to flow the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential wetness. The outcome is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In fact, the space can feel clammy and wet.<p>
