They utilize a series of estimations based upon the British Thermal Systems or BTUs required to heat the area. The larger the space, the more effective the house heater needs to be.

This cooled air ends up being warmer as it circulates through the home; then it recedes to the central air conditioner through return ducts and registers. Find out how central air conditioning conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
