<p>Air toxins can range from contaminants generated from the outdoors by your pets to hazardous gas leaks. Carbon monoxide gas is a typical air toxin arising from gas that gets away into your home without being burned off.

In restrooms and cooking areas, mold and mildew can become an annoyance where moisture levels are normally higher than in the rest of your home.<p>

Such information can often be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring data is not offered, yet a high number of health signs have actually been reported, the Union agent should request that the company have air tracking tests conducted. Review of this information might recognize possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are very low, keeping track of data may not describe the observed or reported health symptoms.<p>
