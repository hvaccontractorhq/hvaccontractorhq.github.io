<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork at Scotts Mills OR</h3>
<p>Particular instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often tough to figure out if the symptoms are a result of direct exposure to indoor air pollution. For this factor, it is essential to pay attention to the time and place signs happen. If the signs fade or go away when a person is away from the area, for example, an effort should be made to identify indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some effects may be worsened by an inadequate supply of outside air coming indoors or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions widespread indoors.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (normally cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>

Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted.

Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.
