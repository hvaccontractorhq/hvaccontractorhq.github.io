<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Second of all like prolonged car warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it the majority of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a customer you need to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to correctly service and the unit has actually been running problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
