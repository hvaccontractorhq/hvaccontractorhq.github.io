What made me choose this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not call back. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will suggest this company to my good friends.<p>
