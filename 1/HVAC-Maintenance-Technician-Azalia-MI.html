<h3>HVAC Repair And You - What You Need to Know in Azalia MI</h3>

<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, inspect these 3 things initially. Make sure all the signs up in your house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go tidy and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased air flow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was clogged. If you've changed the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or until there's great air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to check it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually fixed the issue.<p>

<p>The predominant health effect connected with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your threat of lung cancer is particularly high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
