<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of co2 for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to determine carbon dioxide must be adjusted frequently, and outdoor measurements utilized for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level effects on measurements made outdoors might likewise be necessary.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by distributing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant flows. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might harm the engine parts. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs dealt with by experts, visit Acme Car Electric & Repair today.<p>
