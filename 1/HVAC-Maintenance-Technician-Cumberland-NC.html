<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ may discover unpleasant or musty odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers grumble about signs that take place at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature is regularly in the series of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), since heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice forms on the outdoor system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should temporarily switch back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
