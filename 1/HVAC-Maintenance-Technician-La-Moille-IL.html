<p>Because my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He needed to go get the right replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will absolutely use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
