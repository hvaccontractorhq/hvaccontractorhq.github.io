<h3>Why Fall Is Your Best Time to Buy a New HVAC System in Stephenson VA</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was very clear and quick about his examination, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only negative is that Josh let me understand the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So possibly a little high on cost for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Don't obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "hard part" once a year shut off the electrical energy open the furnace and very carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the elements, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical energy. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
