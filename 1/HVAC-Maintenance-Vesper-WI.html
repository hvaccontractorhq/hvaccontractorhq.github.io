<p>Though it may be hard to think, the air inside your home can be worse than the air exterior. Dust and dander are notorious for reducing the air quality in your home, however there are many other contaminants that can not just unclean up the air, but result in other health complications.

VOCs (volatile organic substances) from paint and even from some kinds of carpets and upholstery products can cause problems. Mold and cigarette smoke can be offenders, too.<p>
<p>Typically the most efficient method to improve indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas stoves, can be adjusted to reduce the amount of emissions. In most cases, source control is likewise a more cost-efficient technique to safeguarding indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air contamination in your home are listed later in this section.<p>
