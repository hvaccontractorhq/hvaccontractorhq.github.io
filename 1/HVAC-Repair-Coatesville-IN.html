<p>Whether you have central air conditioning, a ductless system, or a heat pump, whatever needs to be replaced eventually. As equipment ages, it becomes less efficient.

<p>The majority of central air conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air distribution system. Hence, the exact same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are used to disperse cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool your house. When the ac system works but the house does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
