<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for improving and keeping the quality of the air around a commercial environment. The exact same applies for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils ensures dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also prevents water from building up on and beneath the coils, which can cause mold issues.<p>
