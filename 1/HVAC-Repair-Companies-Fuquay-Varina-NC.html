Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest using "flex duct" (a little, affordable flexible hose) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>If you are considering installing a central heating and air-conditioning system when you don't have one in your home, plan on investing a number of thousand dollars for the complete system. The size of the system determines the labor hours included to develop the system. To equip a home with the ductwork and vents can cost as much as the brand brand-new furnace or more when you consider installation fees upwards of $50 per hour.<p>
