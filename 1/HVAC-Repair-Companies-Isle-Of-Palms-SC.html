<p>Unpredictable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the main factors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals produced as gases from products or processes; for the a lot of part, you can smell their presence. Common sources of VOCs indoors consist of things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as seemingly harmless as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be releasing formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled inside throughout water use.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a combination of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those processes include bringing in outdoors air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. If several of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be impacted.<p>
