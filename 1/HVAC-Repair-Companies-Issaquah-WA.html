<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in gathering info on the phone and supplying clear instructions about how to momentarily handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its treatments, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began.

<p>Current Review: They were fantastic! Numerous HVAC companies focus just on upsell and forget to provide you with the service originally requested.

The team appeared on time, kept me informed as they worked, and completed a little early. The likewise without delay followed up with the required examinations from the city.

<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature level is frequently in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump become inefficient in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice types on the outside unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system must temporarily change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uncomfortable in the winter season.<p>
