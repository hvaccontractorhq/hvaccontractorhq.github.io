<p>The federal government recommends that houses be weatherized in order to lower the amount of energy needed for heating and cooling. While weatherization is underway, however, actions need to also be required to reduce contamination from sources inside the house. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for suggested actions.) In addition, homeowners should look out to the emergence of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surfaces, or mold and mildew development. Extra weatherization measures need to not be carried out until these issues have been corrected.<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to pre-owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of signs in hundreds of countless asthmatic kids, and may cause thousands of nonasth-matic kids to establish the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition made worse by direct exposure to pre-owned smoke each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Details Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
