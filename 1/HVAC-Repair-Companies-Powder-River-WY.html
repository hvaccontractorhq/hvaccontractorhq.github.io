<p>I have actually been operating in HVAC for over 20 years. Now I am beginning my own HVAC company.

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser unit utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>When all the tasks have actually been finished, the last job is to check the system to make certain it cools successfully. HVAC systems are run through the thermostat. This final check may explain faults in the thermostat, which might be as easy as a need to replace batteries. A failure to turn on may just involve a tripped breaker. At the conclusion of the service check, your HVAC technician discusses any concerns or issues and makes recommendations about upgrades where suitable.<p>
