Set up a valve in this pipeline (bypass valve). When this valve is closed and the valves on the inlet and outlet of the standard water heater are open, water will stream from the solar tank to the traditional water heater (typical operation). If the valves on the pipes getting in and the water pipe leaving the standard water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar storage tank past the conventional water heater. This bypass mode can be utilized in the summer when water temperature levels are high, and the traditional hot water heater can be shut down entirely.<p>

Many house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening windows and doors, operating window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen fans that exhaust outdoors eliminate pollutants directly from the space where the fan is located and also increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
