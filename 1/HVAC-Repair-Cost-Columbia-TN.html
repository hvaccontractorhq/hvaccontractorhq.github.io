<p>The main problem when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, considering that a few of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the air conditioning individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>

<h3>Ductless Air Conditioning For Columbia TN Homes With No Air Ducts</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and a/c (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy. The existing trend in house building and construction is to lower air leak through cracks and other openings in floorings, walls, and roofings. The combination of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outside makeup air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for kitchens and bathrooms in homes are much higher. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor impurities and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>
