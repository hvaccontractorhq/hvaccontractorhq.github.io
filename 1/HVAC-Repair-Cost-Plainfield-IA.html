<p>Mike B., I'm not so sure of that. I've got a bud who operates in security for a company that produces much of the plastic used around the globe, including EMV. He's stated numerous times that the distinct code function is lots of and optional, lots of merchants do not utilize it because it slows down transactions much more due to the back-and-forth interactions needed. If that is even possible, I don't know enough about the innovation to know.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it could flatter twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would use. That's since it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Performance Ratio, which is the amount of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but nowadays, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment installed simply a few years ago.<p>
