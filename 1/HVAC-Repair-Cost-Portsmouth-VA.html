<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool spaces down completely on the most popular days and will cost more to operate due to the fact that it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. A large-scale compressor likewise costs more to run due to the fact that it merely takes more electricity to run a larger unit. And an oversize system doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's because it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the essential moisture. The result is a space that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level shows. In reality, the room can feel clammy and damp.<p>
