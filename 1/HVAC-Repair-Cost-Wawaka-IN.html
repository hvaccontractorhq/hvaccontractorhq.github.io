<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Correct ventilation assists improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are often 2 to 5 times higher than outside levels, and in many cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. In other words, in some cases the air inside can be more damaging than the air outside.<p>
<p>The reason for keeping the heat source low is simple. Heat increases, so it makes good sense to locate the heat source at the floor level. This lets the warmth naturally take a trip through the hot" zone, which is from a person's toe to head area. All things in the hot zone reach stability in temperature after the convected heat system has been operating for a while, including individuals. Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in which abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a process called complimentary cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on employing a heatpump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently declining its efficiency.<p>
<p>In addition to getting the huge picture" of your indoor air quality, an indoor air quality monitor can be established to offer threshold signals. If, for instance, the outside air has a CO2 level of 400 ppm, you could set up your monitoring devices to alert you when indoor levels reach 950, and when the air has reached crucial point at 1100 ppm. From there you can take the suitable action to fix the scenario right away.<p>
<p>As soon as the furnace senses that the burner has reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will start to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger permits air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then forced through the house's duct, providing warm air to specific bed rooms, living rooms and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
