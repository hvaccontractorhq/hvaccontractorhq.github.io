<p>A clogged up furnace filter can cause a furnace to shut down. Unclean filters are the most typical reason for furnace problems.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, replace the filter. An unclean filter also triggers soot buildup on the heat exchanger, lowering the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
