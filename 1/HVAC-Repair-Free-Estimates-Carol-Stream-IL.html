Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a distinct DNA on how it builds up dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how often your a/c filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a better ideal decision on how typically your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 homes have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 house, the less typically you'll have to clean them.
