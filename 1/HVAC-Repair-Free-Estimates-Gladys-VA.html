<p>Because the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have actually been making an effort to make the systems they produce more effective. This was originally driven by increasing energy expenses, and has actually more just recently been driven by increased awareness of ecological concerns. In addition, improvements to the HVAC system performance can also assist increase occupant health and performance. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually imposed tighter limitations for many years. There are a number of approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ may observe musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the structure is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling worn out. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are becoming worse, speak to your medical professional about them. However not all exposures cause signs, so there is no replacement for great structure management.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays a crucial role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a structure." Those procedures consist of bringing in outside air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some part of indoor air exterior. The quality of indoor air will be impacted if one or more of these procedures are underperforming.<p>
