<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a referral in the future). Then release the saved energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors need to snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've switched all the wires.<p>
