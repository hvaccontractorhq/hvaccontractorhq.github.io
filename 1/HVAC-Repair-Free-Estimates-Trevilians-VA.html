Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat currency exchange rate, resulting in squandered energy, reduced equipment life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air circulation. In addition, very filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
