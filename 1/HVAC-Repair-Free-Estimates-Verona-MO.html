<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet.

But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily pierced.<p>
