The system hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>There are a number of variables that contribute to indoor air pollution. Such factors consist of using chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas released by cigarette smoke and outdoors traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls contained in electrical transformers; radiation from building insulation; ozone from copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
