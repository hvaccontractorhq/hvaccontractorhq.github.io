<p>Co2 concentrations increase as an outcome of human occupancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of constant occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure carbon dioxide need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature results on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
