<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was very clear and fast about his evaluation, ensuring I comprehended what was looked out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So maybe a little high on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was good overall.<p>
