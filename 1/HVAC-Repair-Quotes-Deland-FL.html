Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame suggestion is blue. If you acquire a brand-new gas range or range, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns continually. Never ever utilize a gas range to heat your home. When the fireplace is in usage, always make specific the flue in your gas fireplace is open.<p>
