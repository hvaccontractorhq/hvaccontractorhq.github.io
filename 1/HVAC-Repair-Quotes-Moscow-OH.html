<h3>How to Keep Healthy Ductwork To Get A Healthy Home in Moscow OH</h3>
<p>When developing your new house a well-functioning Cooling and heating system is important, in addition to the air quality you breathe within. We have the experience and resources required to help from the planning phases through to the last installation. We utilize the current software to help design your ductwork system and use the highest quality materials in the building and installation.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will enable the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently done in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
