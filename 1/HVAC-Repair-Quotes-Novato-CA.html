<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "consistent state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of assessing the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after a prolonged period of consistent tenancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be an affordable indication of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments used to measure carbon dioxide must be adjusted often, and outside measurements used for estimations should be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level results on measurements made outdoors may likewise be essential.<p>
<p>Next, and maybe simply as crucial when it comes to central air costs, is the AC system's size. An unit that is too large will have an easy time keeping the home cool, but will have a more difficult time removing humidity from the air. On the other hand, an unit that is too little will not be able to correctly cool the home on hot days. Thinking about larger units cost more than smaller systems, it pays to ask a local HVAC expert what size AC system your central air conditioning system needs to hold.<p>
<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, carefully insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be utilized on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation utilized outside ought to be protected with PVC insulation covers.<p>
