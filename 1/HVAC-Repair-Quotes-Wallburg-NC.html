<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and requires yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is actually not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was less expensive for me to purchase stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are just insane and all over the location and I guess they understand they gotchya" if you need a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m truly choosy with my stuff. I like my devices and devices initial, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with cheap knock-offs. So buying this ac system to replace my old one was somewhat of a tough reality. You canâ $ t trust the commercial nowadays. Because it has restored my faith in good manufacturing, am thankful I got this though. I havenâ $ t had an issue with this new Provider I got because I purchased it 7 months back. Itâ $ s just best.<p>
