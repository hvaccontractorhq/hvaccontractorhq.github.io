<h3>Commercial HVAC Contractors in Buffalo Grove Illinois</h3>
<p>Fact: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. All the water is returned to that exact same aquifer if an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, however those are exceptionally rare now. When applied commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been evaporated in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>If you have a big house, a house with high ceilings, a house with lots of windows or a home with insufficient insulation, heating your floors rather than the air may not be enough to reach the level of comfort to which you are accustomed.

These changes could really accumulate and possibly reduce your viewed need for in-floor heating.<p>
<p>In the UK, the Ozone Regulations 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Policy banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This indicates that equipment that uses R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leak. Although R22 is now prohibited, units that utilize the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>
