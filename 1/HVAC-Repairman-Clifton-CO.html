<p>Mark (owner) and group were great from start to end up. I 'd priced out brand-new units and installation for months. As soon as I chose to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Heap system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific however Mark went out of his method to tailor a couple of things in my home to make the total air flow more enhanced. I think it literally only took them 6 hours overall time (start to surface) to get my unit set up. I have no doubt any future business associated to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
