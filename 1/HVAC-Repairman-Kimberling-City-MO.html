<p>A vehicle's coolant system transfers excess heat from one part of the engine and finally loses it through the radiator fins. With time, the coolant becomes filthy and old. The old coolant will negatively affect the system's efficiency. To make certain the system is working effectively, consider having a regular coolant system flush. A coolant flush is fundamental maintenance for your cars and truck's cooling system. Call 206-523-2133 or visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair in Seattle, WA 98103 for all your coolant system flush and fill needs.<p>
<p>It might be time to clean the condensing uni t Unclean condenser coils won't offer off heat effectively and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have welded together-- something that can happen in time since of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Before inspecting the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This should suffice up until you purchase a replacement-- which you need to do quickly.<p>
