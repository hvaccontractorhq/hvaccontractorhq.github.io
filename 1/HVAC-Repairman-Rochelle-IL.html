<h3>What to Think about when Buying a Heat Pump in Rochelle IL</h3>
<p>When temps outside start to heat up, you rely on your air conditioner to cool you cool. But in order to preserve a comfortable indoor environment, you need every part of your a/c system to be working its finest.

<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the required cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in climates where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
