The primary path of exposure is through the production of an aerosol impact, the majority of typically from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly placed or maintained evaporative cooling towers, which typically launch water in an aerosol which may go into nearby ventilation consumption. Outbreaks in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most frequently reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public destinations. The existence of Legionella in commercial structure water products is extremely under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to get infection.<p>
