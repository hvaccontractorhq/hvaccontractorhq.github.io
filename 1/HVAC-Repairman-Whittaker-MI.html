<p>Discover PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends on how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (revealed as a portion efficiency rate) and just how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering component (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A really effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not work, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends on maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>
