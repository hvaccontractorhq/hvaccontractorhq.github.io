Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention measure.

<h3>Is The Furnace Running at Top Efficiency in Cerrillos NM?</h3>
<p>The majority of people are aware that outdoor air pollution can affect their health, but indoor air pollution can also have significant, damaging impact. EPA studies of human direct exposure to air pollutants show that indoor levels of pollutants might be two to five times-- and periodically more than 100 times-- higher than outdoor levels. The EPA and its Science Advisory Board consistently rank indoor air contamination among the leading five ecological health dangers to the general public.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the required cool air, this will permit the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently carried out in environments where humidity is more of a concern. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
