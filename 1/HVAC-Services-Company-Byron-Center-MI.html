<p>Recognized as a leader in the HVAC industry, Bard Manufacturing combines quality items and impressive service with innovation and technological advances to provide high-performance heating & cooling products all over the world. A multi-split system 56 is a traditional split system, which is divided into two parts (evaporator and condenser) and permits cooling or heating of several rooms with one external system. In the outdoor system of this air conditioner there is a more powerful compressor, ports for linking several traces and automation with locking valves for managing the volume of refrigerant provided to the indoor units located in the room.<p>
<p>In 1995, Germany made CFC fridges illegal. 30 DuPont and other companies blocked the refrigerant in the U.S. with the U.S. EPA, disparaging the technique as "that German technology". 29 31 Nevertheless, in 2004, Greenpeace worked with international corporations like Coca-Cola and Unilever, and later Pepsico and others, to create a business coalition called Refrigerants Naturally!. 30 32 Then, four years later on, Ben & Jerry's of Unilever and General Electric began to take actions to support production and use in the U.S. 33 In 2011 the EPA decided in favor of the ozone- and climate-safe refrigerant for U.S. manufacture. 25 34 35 HFCs like R-134a, r-404a and r-410a are, as of 2020, being changed with HFO and hydrocarbon refrigerants like R-1234ze in chillers for commercial refigeration and air conditioning, R-1234yf in cars, R-32 in residential a/c and CO2 (R-744) in commercial refrigeration. R-600 (isobutane) is already extensively used in residential refrigeration.<p>
