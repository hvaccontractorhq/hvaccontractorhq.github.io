<p>Some a/c systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also frequently referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is substantially more energy effective than electric resistance heating, because it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, in addition to the heat from bought electrical energy. When the heat pump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outside condenser system likewise switches roles to function as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outdoor air).<p>
<p>. Prior to choosing the installation place of air conditioning unit, several main elements require to be considered. First of all, the direction of air circulation from the indoor systems need to not fall on the location of rest or work area.
