<p>Current Evaluation: I've changed to Bob's from my previous company due to the fact that the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and hung out exercising the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
