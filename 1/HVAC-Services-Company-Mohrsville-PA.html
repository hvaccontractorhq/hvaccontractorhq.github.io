<p>Luis was instantly responsive to email and texts with concerns. He devoted to the job based just on emails, showed up and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the few sensible ones got. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name devices. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up team was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated quantity of time. post install inspection results look great for braising and pipes quality. New unit cools much better than the 13 year old 4 ton R22 system it replaced (likewise Carrier).<p>
