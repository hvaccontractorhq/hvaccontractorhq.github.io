<h3>Why Choose A Gas Furnace in Germanton NC?</h3>
<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window plan systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and must be changed or washed as conditions warrant. For instance, a structure in a high dust environment, or a house with furry animals, will need to have the filters changed more frequently than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to wasted energy, reduced equipment life, and greater energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Additionally, extremely unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system and even fire.<p>
