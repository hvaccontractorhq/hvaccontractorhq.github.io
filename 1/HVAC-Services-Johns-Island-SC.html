<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. Radiant heat systems have actually been around because the days of the Romans when they laid a network of pipes under their marble floors and connected them into a warm water supply. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and an elementary pumping device to distribute warm water that warmed their stone floorings. In turn, the harmony of the floor heat transferred heat to other articles in the rooms, including the human occupants.<p>
<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating unit, including electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most typical, though all radiant heating systems run on comparable principles. When it comes to a boiler, the system heats by dispersing hot water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each room. When it comes to electric radiant heating systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating elements. As the hot water (or electrical power) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>
