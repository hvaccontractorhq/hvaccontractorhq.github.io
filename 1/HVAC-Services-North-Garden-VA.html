<p>Indoor temperature levels are sometimes more difficult to manage than they appear due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity should be maintained at or listed below 65%.

<p>Biological pollutants consist of germs, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house allergen, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant debris; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Contaminated central air conditioning handling systems can end up being reproducing grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then distribute these impurities through the home.<p>
