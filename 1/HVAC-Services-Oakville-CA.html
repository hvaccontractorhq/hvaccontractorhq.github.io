<p>All homes need efficient ventilation. The quality of indoor air inside workplaces, schools, and other work environments is important not just for employees' convenience but also for their health.

Also, some particular diseases have been linked to specific air pollutants or indoor environments, like asthma with wet indoor environments. In addition, some direct exposures, such as asbestos and radon, do not cause immediate symptoms but can lead to cancer after several years.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage current to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years approximately. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new unit (Photo 6).<p>

<p>The primary health impact connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may posture threats, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes thousands of preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your risk of lung cancer is specifically high.<p>
