<p>A packaged unit, usually installed on the roof, is most frequently utilized on commercial buildings, however it is also an option for property owners to think about. Many times, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself but likewise a furnace. An advantage of this unit is definitely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those seeking to save money on the installation of a brand-new cooling and heating system separately, given that the system is combined. However, one con is that these systems are generally only offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capacity. Additionally, while they can be a good way to conserve cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than purchasing simply a cooling system. For that reason, this may not be the best choice for homeowners looking for short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
