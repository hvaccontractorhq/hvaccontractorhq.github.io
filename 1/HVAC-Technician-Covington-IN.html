<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they had to order it. My spouse stated that she had seen a great evaluation for James, so I called. He came in a couple of hours (weaving a mask) and explained the scenario to me. He stated it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 total. He provided to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is one of the nicest, most decent individuals I have actually met in a long period of time. We require to support the genuine people who are there for us if we desire to have alternatives to ACME heating. Please do.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. , if they weren't successful you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the required abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with customers fairly. As a consumer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. A lot of companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to appropriately service and the unit has been operating problem free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
