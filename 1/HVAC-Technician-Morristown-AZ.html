Heat pumps move heat from outside the structure into the air within. At first, heat pump HVAC systems were just used in moderate environments, however with improvements in low temperature operation and lowered loads due to more efficient houses, they are increasing in appeal in cooler environments.<p>

<p>Today's house radiant heat systems make the most of infrared radiation. Without a doubt, the most common source of a radiator in a home is the floor mass. Radiators can be locally located in one location like a restroom flooring or be installed across the whole sub-surface of the house's floorings. Other radiators are still used, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating units-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>
<p>HVAC is an important part of residential structures such as single family homes, apartment buildings, hotels and senior living facilities, medium to big commercial and office complex such as skyscrapers and health centers, cars such as cars, trains, planes, ships and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy building conditions are regulated with regard to temperature level and humidity, utilizing fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. At the same time, heat is soaked up from indoors and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
