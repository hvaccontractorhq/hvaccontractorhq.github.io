<p>Heating is the largest energy cost in the typical house. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, often referred to as overload coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outside air through a damp pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced.

Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be quite substantial if the getting in air is dry enough.<p>
