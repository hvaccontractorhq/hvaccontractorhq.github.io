He understood simply what the problem was and repaired it really quickly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went completely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
