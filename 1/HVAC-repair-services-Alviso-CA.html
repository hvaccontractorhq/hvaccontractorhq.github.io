<h3>AC Repair Contractor in Alviso CA</h3>
<p>I have been using them for many years for my services, my own houses and my property clients' houses. I went through 5 other companies before I discovered Luis at Protex Comfort Control. All five other companies estimated me with various rates and different issues that didn't make any sense. Luis was the sixth individual, who explained to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental home, another event. He helped me problem shoot the concern when I called and he advised me to contact warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the unit working again. He is truthful, reliable, and sensible on price. It's tough to find a sincere AC person and I'm thankful I discovered Luis. Highly suggest Luis and his company.<p>
