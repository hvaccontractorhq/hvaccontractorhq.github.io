<p>Truth: Geothermal systems in fact consume no water. If an aquifer is utilized to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that very same aquifer. In the past, there were some pump and dump" operations that wasted the water after passing over the heat exchanger, but those are exceptionally rare now. When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems actually remove millions of gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>The technological developments in heating devices have been improving every year. Boilers and furnaces now use less fuel to provide heat and hot water, are a lot easier to keep, and are also smaller and quieter.

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a routine oil modification in your car. A filthy filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and eventually reduce its life through wear and tear. Moreover, a fresh, tidy filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every three months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters at least regular monthly.<p>
