<h3>Turning to the Right Company for the Right Furnace Repair in Cressona PA</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were really pleased that somebody as experienced as Adam had the ability to repair the air and return conditioner. We had purchased the club member maintenance strategy, which helped balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our idea to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to evaluate the ac system before you buy. We purchased this house in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had ways to evaluate AC units even in winter season. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the need to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically chilled water or a direct growth "DX" system), hence conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outside air should be less energetic than the return air for the system to enter the economizer mode.<p>
