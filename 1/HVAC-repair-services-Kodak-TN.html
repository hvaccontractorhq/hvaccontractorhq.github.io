<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you might believe. Because most ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a little, economical versatile hose pipe) instead of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and wear and is easily pierced.<p>
<p>Geographically, some locations pay regularly greater salaries for air conditioning tradespersons.

According to BLS figures, Alaska had the country's highest typical earnings for HVAC professionals at $29.64 per hour or $61,660 each year. The District of Columbia ranked 2nd, at $28.41 per hour or $59,090 annually. New Jersey had the third-highest average wage, at $26.71 per hour or $55,560 each year. Massachusetts and Connecticut rounded out the 5 highest-paying states, at $26.62 and $26.59 per hour or $55,380 and $55,310 annually.<p>

<p>The primary health result associated with exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may pose dangers, too, although these are thought to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could range from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths annually. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
