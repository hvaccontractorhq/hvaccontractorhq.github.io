<p>Scott performed the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outdoor system as close to the house as possible per my request. The job took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left clean during and after the work.

<h3>Preventive HVAC Maintenance in Merrimac WI</h3>

The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the new high effectiveness heating system.

Nevertheless, measures such as setting up storm windows, weather condition stripping, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the amount of outside air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
