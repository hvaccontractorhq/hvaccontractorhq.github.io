<p>Sean was extremely practical. He is a very enjoyable person to deal with. No pressure used to purchase extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put rise protectors on the system and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to make sure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor. Due to the fact that there was not one on hand, the only reason he might not install the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.. Second of all like prolonged car guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is actually sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be entirely benefited from. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to properly service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the exact same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered somebody to properly service and the system has actually been operating issue free for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
