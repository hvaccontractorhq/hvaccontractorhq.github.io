<p>The evaporator coil is most likely frozen. The cause is usually an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is triggered by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC unit, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and try once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
