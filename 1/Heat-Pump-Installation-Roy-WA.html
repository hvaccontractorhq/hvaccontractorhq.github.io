<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time exercising the issue. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<h3>Elements of a High Efficiency Furnace in Roy WA</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Performance (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went excellent. Dealing with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 different hot water heater. 2 as needed tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We chose getting something more costly than a standard water heater as gas is one of our biggest energy expenses. We feel that this new unit will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
