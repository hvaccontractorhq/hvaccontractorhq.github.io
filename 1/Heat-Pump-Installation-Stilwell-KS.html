<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Just take a photo of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you might need a reference later). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp connectors must snap securely onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. Eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you have actually swapped all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
