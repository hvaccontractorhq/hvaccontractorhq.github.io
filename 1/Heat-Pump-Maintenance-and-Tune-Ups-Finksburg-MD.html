<p>Once the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to introduce air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be heated up without coming in contact with the real flame or burner area. Once it reaches an adequate temperature level, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the home's duct work, supplying warm air to specific bedrooms, living spaces and kitchens through the vents or signs up.<p>
