<p>Your lungs are responsible for bringing fresh air into your body, while all at once eliminating waste gases and particulates.

Poor air quality - whether it is inside your home or outdoors - can make it progressively hard for your lungs to work correctly, and can have unfavorable health impacts.<p>
<p>Because pesticides can be found far from the website of their original application, it is sensible to reduce using chemical pesticides outdoors as well as inside your home. Depending on the site and bug to be controlled, several of the following steps can be effective: use of biological pesticides, such as Bacillus thuringiensis, for the control of gypsy moths; choice of disease-resistant plants; and frequent washing of indoor plants and animals. Termite damage can be minimized or avoided by ensuring that wood structure materials do not come into direct contact with the soil and by keeping fire wood away from the home. By appropriately fertilizing, watering, and aerating lawns, the need for chemical pesticide treatments of yards can be considerably lowered.<p>
