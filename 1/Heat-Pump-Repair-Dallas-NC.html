<p>There is no easy response, but many use the rule of thumb that if a repair amounts to around 50% of the cost of a brand-new furnace, changing is probably a better option. If the present system has actually not incurred other significant repairs, is in otherwise outstanding condition, and concerns that resulted in the breakdown can be determined and fixed, repairing the system can make a lot of sense too.<p>
<p>Start by checking out the installation manual and acquainting yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Most systems include a kit that includes adjustable window extensions and metal installing brackets. These parts will ensure an airtight and secure fit in the window opening. And for extra assistance, especially for bigger air conditioning system, think about purchasing a steel support bracket and mount it to the outside home wall, straight below the windowsill.<p>
