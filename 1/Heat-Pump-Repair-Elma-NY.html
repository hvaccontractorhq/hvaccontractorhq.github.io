<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a variety of contaminants that have the potential to negatively impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungi, germs, and really little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor must evaluate and, if necessary, update the structure envelope. For instance, he may seal gaps and cracks in the outer walls and attic floor, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which could knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation may be a more effective option to your cooling issues than changing your equipment.<p>
