Depending on the type of system set up, it can be noisy and trigger problems if you're highly allergic to dust.

<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>The piping-- which is woven throughout the flooring as a circulation system. Metal pipes are seldom used due to long-lasting corrosive issues. Essentially all hydronic radiant flooring heat systems today use 1/2 inch size plastic tubing made from PEX or Cross-linked Polyethylene piping. PEX is highly versatile, won't rust and is available in long lengths, which permit PEX pipeline to be woven with minimal or no joints.<p>
