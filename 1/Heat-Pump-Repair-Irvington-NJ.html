<p>It is common to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, fairly stable with time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical product with time. In reality, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and comprehended as complex systems. Research study using the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
