<p>Gas heaters do come with some drawbacks. The most significant downside is also the result of the combustion process.

<p>Biological contaminants: the biological pollutants can include germs, infections, fungis (mold), dust mite allergen, animal dander, insect bio detritus, fibers and fiberglass, pollen, cockroach irritant, etc. and may result from inadequate maintenance and house cleaning, water spills, insufficient humidity control, condensation, or may be brought into the building by residents, seepage, or ventilation air.

<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When saving money, the control system will open (fully or partly) the outside air damper and close (fully or partly) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will permit the need to be satisfied without using the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly done in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
