<p>Radiant heating covers a series of various heating unit, consisting of electric heating systems and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on comparable principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by dispersing warm water through a series of pipes installed in the sub-floor of each space. When it comes to electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates heat up through the flooring and into the space.<p>
