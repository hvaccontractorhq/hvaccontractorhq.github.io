<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task locating the outdoor system as near to your home as possible per my demand. The task took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He stayed until 7pm on a Friday night to ensure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>Wetness management and humidity control needs running HVAC systems as created. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to optimize the operation to save energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply make-up air at lower temperatures (design levels), rather of the higher temperatures sometimes used to save energy in cooling-dominated environment conditions. However, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperatures are cool enough that the air does not need more cooling to offer thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors develops the need for mindful attention to humidity levels inside your home. High humidities give rise to mold growth and moisture indoors is related to a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory issues.<p>
<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous provider since the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, tidy, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time finding the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
