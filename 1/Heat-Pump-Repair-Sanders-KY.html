The energy performance of central air conditioning systems is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
