<p>How environment change impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a basic mode of operation for modern-day air conditioners) requires that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This boost has the result that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the ac system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner should increase its power usage by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating aspect is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power usage will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
