<h3>Gas Central Heating in Helena AL</h3>

Depending on the kind of system installed, it can be noisy and trigger issues if you're extremely adverse dust.

<p>People working in buildings with bad IAQ may discover musty or undesirable odors or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and go away when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more serious issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Disease and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ problems. Talk to your medical professional about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse.

<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Purchased a brand-new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never purchase prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I do not require.<p>
