Search for a basic wall switch on or near the furnace-- all furnaces, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Inspect the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make sure the front panel covering the blower motor is safely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to operate.<p>

Whether this is the reason for the issue, it's an excellent early remedy to attempt. Plan to do this on a reasonably warm day. Never use a power washer for this-- it can damage the fins.

<p>Most central air conditioning conditioners are connected to a house's forced-air circulation system. Therefore, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is running, hot air inside the house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the a/c unit works however your home doesn't cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
