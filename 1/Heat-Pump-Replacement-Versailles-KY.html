Gone is that rush of hot air when the furnace kicks in which abrupt shot of coolness when it shuts down.<p>

<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning fossil fuels such as gas, coal, or oil. Instead, it absorbs heat from within the earth. Furthermore, a geothermal heating and cooling system uses considerably less electrical energy compared to a standard electric heat-resistance heat pump. This makes a geothermal heating unit an appealing service to cut your carbon footprint, supplying a favorable impact on the environment.<p>
<p>Prior to setting up any new heating or cooling system in a home, it is needed to re examine and lower the energy load of the home. A more energy effective house will not just lower the cost of a new system and utility costs, but it will greatly enhance the convenience of your house. Before we design and set up any systems, we set up a home energy audit in which an energy auditor will recommend enhancements and make estimates for cost and energy cost savings from these improvements. Fundamental improvements typically include adding insulation and air sealing procedures. Energy Environmental Corporation works with and can suggest a number of qualified home Energy Star auditors and installation professionals. Please Contact United States for references.<p>
