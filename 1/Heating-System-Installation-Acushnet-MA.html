<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you might (for the most part) draw power from a surrounding GFCI-protected outlet without overwhelming the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is currently GFCI secured like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad must be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that might also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to install a devoted circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
