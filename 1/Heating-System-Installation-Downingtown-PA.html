<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 service technicians I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
