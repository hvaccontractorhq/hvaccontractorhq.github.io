<p>Recent Evaluation: I've switched to Bob's from my previous company since the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and hung around exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the problem, the solution and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My oldest child always complained about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it truly didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t truly think about anything else other than replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s terrific on energy saving too.<p>
