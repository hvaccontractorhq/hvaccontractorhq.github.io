<p>Fantastic Item! Delivery was kind of weird being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was incredibly lite weight and takes time to apply. Note: purchase recommended non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We utilized the Kerdi as advised to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower flooring and curb to fit.

<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to water down polluted (indoor) air. Local building codes most likely define the amount (and often quality) of outside air that should be continuously supplied in your structures, as do voluntary requirements set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation combined with appropriate use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for instance, can be helpful in diluting the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
