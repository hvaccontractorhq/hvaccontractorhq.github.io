<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Convected heat systems are increasingly popular, especially in the previous quarter-century as technology has advanced, and the systems have shown themselves in reliability and economy. Unlike convection heating, convected heat systems have no ductwork and no air circulation. Radiant systems depend upon heat transfer by the infrared clinical concept used by the sun called view." These undetectable electromagnetic infrared waves radiate out from a warmed thermal mass. In an included system like a home, the warmer objects naturally heat the cooler ones up until a balance is achieved.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix used in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most designs changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer produced in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and utilized by licensed HVAC professionals. For systems requiring just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and performing far better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "inexpensive" by lots of individuals.<p>
