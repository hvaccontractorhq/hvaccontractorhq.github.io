<p>This is particularly notable, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be prohibited outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately adjusted gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater.
