<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
