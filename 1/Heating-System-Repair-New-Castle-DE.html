<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You need to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have extremely little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not offer vehicle debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of cash can be found in monthly, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" during the sluggish times of the year. If we do choose to offer vehicle debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this helps.<p>

<p>Poor indoor air quality is generally triggered by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which results in a buildup of pollutants from sources in the house.

<p>To establish a safe consultation or appointment with an HVAC technician during the COVID-19 pandemic, start by comparing service technicians in your location in an online search.

<p>Individuals operating in structures with poor IAQ might see undesirable or musty odors or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about signs that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some causes of pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, speak with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to good structure management.<p>
