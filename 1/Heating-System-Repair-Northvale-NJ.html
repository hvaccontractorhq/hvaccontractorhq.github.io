While weatherization is underway, nevertheless, steps must likewise be required to reduce pollution from sources inside the home. (See "Improving the Air Quality in Your Home" for advised actions.) In addition, citizens need to look out to the introduction of indications of insufficient ventilation, such as stuffy air, moisture condensation on cold surface areas, or mold and mildew development. Additional weatherization measures must not be undertaken up until these problems have been corrected.<p>

For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and triggering premature deterioration, leading to holes and cracks. , if that customer had gotten a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure remains in line and secures the part.. a really beneficial result and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
