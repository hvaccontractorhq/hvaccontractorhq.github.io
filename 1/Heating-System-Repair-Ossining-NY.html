<p>We suggest utilizing our insulation boards when installing over concrete slabs. Warmup Insulation Boards will conserve you cash when used in conjunction with underfloor heating by serving as an extremely efficient thermal barrier. They shows the heat upwards into the flooring tile rather of permitting heat to heat up the concrete piece below. By utilizing Warmup Insulation Boards you will discover that after switching on your heating, your flooring tiles will heat up in about 10-15 minutes. Without insulation boards it could take anything from 2-3 hours, or more.<p>

At the same time, heat is absorbed from indoors and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
