Indoor air pollution studies have actually identified several contaminants that can be present in indoor air.

CONTAM has actually been used at NIST to study the indoor air quality effects of HVAC systems in single-family residential buildings, ventilation in big mechanically-ventilated office complex, and radon entry and transportation in big residential, workplace, and school buildings.<p>

<p>The predominant health effect connected with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon. Major health companies (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) agree with estimates that radon causes thousands of avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. Your danger of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your home has high radon levels.<p>
