<p>Heating is the largest energy expenditure in the typical home. In very dry environments, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for enhancing coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a gadget that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a big sponge soaked with water. The sensible heat of the inbound air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the sensible heat of the going into air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>
