<p>The majority of well and city water does not typically include lead. Water generally picks up lead inside the home from household pipes that is made with lead products.

<p>Next, and maybe simply as essential when it comes to central air conditioning costs, is the AC system's size. A system that is too big will have an easy time keeping the house cool, however will have a more difficult time getting rid of humidity from the air.

<p>Air-source heatpump are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily switch back into the regular a/c mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is triggered just in this mode in order to compensate for the momentary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
