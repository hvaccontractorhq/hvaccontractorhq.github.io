<p>All houses require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on but the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been stressed out from use. Another possible factor might be a damaged thermostat, avoiding the furnace from getting used to the appropriate temperature. Furnaces that kick on regularly may be because of a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it turns on or is humming, there may be an internal problem.
