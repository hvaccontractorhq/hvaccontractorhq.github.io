<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Madison Heights Michigan</h3>
<p>My house has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" discovered something incorrect with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit required "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and grumbled) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>
<p>Many individuals tend to forget or disregard about their heating systems up until they quit working.

Prior to choosing whether to repair or replace your condenser and blower units, your technician should run a duct-leakage test, by sealing the vents and measuring just how much air escapes the system.<p>
