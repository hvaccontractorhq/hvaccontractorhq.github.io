<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't rewarding you would not provide them.. Secondly like prolonged car service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks do not have the essential skills to do the task and likewise the morals to treat customers fairly. As a client you need to be well notified in order not to be completely benefited from. A lot of companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to effectively service and the unit has been running issue totally free for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
