The sensible heat of the inbound air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is decreased. The temperature level of the inbound air is decreased, however it is likewise more humid, so the total heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to hidden heat by the evaporation of water in the damp cooler pads. The results can be quite significant if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
