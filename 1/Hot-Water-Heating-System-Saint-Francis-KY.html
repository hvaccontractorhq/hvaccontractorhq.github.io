<p>Certain instant effects are similar to those from colds or other viral diseases, so it is often hard to identify if the signs are a result of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this reason, it is important to take notice of the time and place the symptoms happen. If the symptoms fade or go away when a person is away from the house and return when the individual returns, an effort needs to be made to recognize indoor air sources that may be possible causes. Some impacts may be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air or from the humidity, heating, or cooling conditions widespread in the house.<p>
<p>In a location where temperature levels reach freezing, air-source heat pumps make good primary heating unit. You'll want to have a backup system installed, such as a gas furnace, which can take over when temperature levels reach freezing. If temperatures reach and drop below freezing, your heating technician can install controls which automatically shut down the heat pump. The controls will call for the furnace to come on, efficiently heating the home in these conditions.<p>
<p>. The compressor-based refrigerant systems are air-cooled, suggesting they use air to exchange heat, in the same method as a car radiator or typical household a/c unit does. Such a system dehumidifies the air as it cools it. It gathers water condensed from the cooled air and produces hot air which needs to be vented outside the cooled area; doing so transfers heat from the air in the cooled area to the outdoors air.<p>
