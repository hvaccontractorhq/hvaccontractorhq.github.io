<p>The instructions that included the mat and thermostat were so darn excellent we felt comfy completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the new circuit breaker and final connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrical expert. We suggest you do the same. Once the electrical wiring is total, energize the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into complete operation till the thin-set and grout have had time to effectively solidify and cure-- usually two to four weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm bathroom flooring.<p>
