<p>Streamline your services, make more services revenue, and provide a fantastic customer experience. To make sure the unit you choose is the best size for your house, the Sears HVAC expert does an electronic load computation quote to determine the exact kind of heat and cooling system that's ideal for your home-we don't simply change it with the same size unit you currently have. These computations think about things such as the size of your house, its direct exposure to the sun and wind, the number and size of windows, how well insulated it is and more. This step is essential so the system isn't too large-both or too little waste energy.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding job finding the outside unit as near to the house as possible per my request. The task took two days and my yard and basement were left clean during and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider because the 2 specialists I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the solution and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
