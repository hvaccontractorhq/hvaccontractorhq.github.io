<h3>The History of Air Source Heat Pumps in Tuckahoe NJ</h3>
<p>Stability Energy Systems (IES) called us through the CPW program to bid on various house efficiency upgrades (furnace, hot water heater, insulation and sealing.) Taylor took adequate time to help us discuss which upgrades were cost effective, which upgrades we could do ourselves and what would yield us the biggest savings. We never felt rushed and Taylor's technical understanding of IES's services and products was remarkable. Taylor helped us narrow the scope to an affordable level, a heatpump replacement for our oil furnace, while allowing me to perform the needed electrical enhancements to save money on cost.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance contract is not worth the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a hose two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet.

Now the "hard part" once a year turned off the electricity open the furnace and extremely carefully vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the components, close up the cabinet returned on the electricity. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
