<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile service warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the absence of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the essential abilities to do the job and also the morals to deal with customers relatively. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Most companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to appropriately service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to offer brand-new versus repair.
