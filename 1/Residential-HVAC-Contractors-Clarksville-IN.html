<p>HVAC is a vital part of residential structures such as single family houses, apartment, hotels and senior living centers, medium to large commercial and office buildings such as health centers and high-rise buildings, vehicles such as cars and trucks, trains, ships, aircrafts and submarines, and in marine environments, where safe and healthy structure conditions are managed with regard to temperature and humidity, using fresh air from outdoors.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is enabled to vaporize, for this reason the heat exchanger is frequently called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
