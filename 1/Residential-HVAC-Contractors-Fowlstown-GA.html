Fetuses, infants, and children are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups because lead is more easily soaked up into growing bodies, and the tissues of kids are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Kids may have higher exposures because they are more likely to get lead dust on their hands and after that put their fingers or other lead-contaminated things into their mouths.<p>
