<p>Even if you do not feel dirty, pollen hold on to your hair and clothes where it can easily irritate your nose and eyes, and contribute to indoor air contamination.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it operates at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to provide a particular cooling output. Up until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices set up just a couple of years ago.<p>
<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters frequently, they're not joking. It's as essential as a regular oil change in your vehicle. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, take in more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter more effectively traps contaminants and particles in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. Throughout high use months, examine the filters a minimum of month-to-month.<p>
