<h3>Truth About Dulce NM Homeowners Need To Know About Ductwork</h3>

<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool rooms down totally on the most popular days and will cost more to run because it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Since it just takes more electricity to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it turns off before it has a chance to distribute the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature shows. In fact, the room can feel damp and clammy.<p>
