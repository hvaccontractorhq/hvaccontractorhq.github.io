The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
