<p>Reality: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts years, given that it is secured indoors. When it does need to be replaced, the expenditure is much less than putting in an entire new geothermal system, considering that the loop or well is the most costly to install. New technical guidelines eliminate the issue of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever. In the past, some incorrectly sized systems did overcool the ground or get too hot in time, to the point that the system no longer had enough of a temperature level gradient to operate.<p>
