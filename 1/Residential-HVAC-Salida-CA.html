<p>Great Product! Shipment was kind of unusual being that package was opened and items could have fell out. But after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes time to use. Note: purchase suggested non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and needed to change the shower flooring and curb to fit. Be sure to view the video initially prior to installation and follow all instructions precisely. If you have any problems call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets.
