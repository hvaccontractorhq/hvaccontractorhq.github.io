<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to run since it has to run longer than a properly sized system. Due to the fact that it merely takes more electrical power to run a bigger unit, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity effectively. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has an opportunity to distribute the proper volume of air past the coils to draw out the necessary moisture. The result is a room that doesn't seem as cool as the temperature level indicates. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>
