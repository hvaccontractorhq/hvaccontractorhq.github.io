<p>These people have been excellent. At a real estate agent, I often need contractors to give me an opinion for what work on a house might cost. Just recently I needed to contact these guys twice. They came out quickly and gave me a no nonsense quote for the work. Even when it was news my customer probably would not wish to hear, they didn't sugar coat anything. I appreciate the honesty. Stability isn't simply their name, it's a service model they take seriously. You guys are formally on speed dial. Talk with you quickly.<p>
<p>Individuals operating in buildings with bad IAQ may discover undesirable or moldy smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees complain about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be symptoms of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ problems. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent structure management.<p>
<p>Advanced styles of brand-new houses are starting to feature mechanical systems that bring outside air into the house. Some of these styles consist of energy-efficient heat recovery ventilators (likewise called air-to-air heat exchangers). For more information about air-to-air heat exchangers, call the Preservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral Service (CAREIRS), PO Box 3048, Merrifield, VA 22116; (800) 523-2929.<p>
