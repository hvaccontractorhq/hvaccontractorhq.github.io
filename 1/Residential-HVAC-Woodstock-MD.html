One is hydronic where water or a specific fluid like glycol is warmed by some kind of a fuel-fired boiler and is then flowed through a piping system under the floor surface area. The 2nd is by electric radiator panels where the electric wires or cables set under the floor are required to resist existing, which then generates heat.<p>
