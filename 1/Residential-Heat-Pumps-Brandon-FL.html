<p>CARBOHYDRATE is actively associated with the advancement of green structure standards and indoor air quality standards.

CARB also carries out and sponsors research into all aspects of indoor air quality, with a focus on identifying levels of exposure to hazardous indoor air pollutants, and seeking ways to prevent and decrease that direct exposure.<p>
