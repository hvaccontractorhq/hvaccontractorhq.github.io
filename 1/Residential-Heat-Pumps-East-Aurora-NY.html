During the 1970s, lots of homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation procedure. However, a number of these homes were discovered to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this item. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decline with time; for that reason, houses in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
