If your a/c is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leaks. If it leakages, simply including refrigerant is not an option. A trained technician should repair any leak, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the correct quantity of refrigerant. Bear in mind that the performance and efficiency of your a/c unit is greatest when the refrigerant charge exactly matches the producer's requirements, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leaks can also be harmful to the environment.<p>
<p>The first air conditioning system and refrigerators utilized harmful or combustible gases, such as ammonia, methyl chloride, or gas, that might result in deadly accidents when they leaked. Thomas Midgley, Jr. developed the first non-flammable, non-toxic chlorofluorocarbon gas, Freon (R-12), in 1928. The name is a brand name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names include a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A).
