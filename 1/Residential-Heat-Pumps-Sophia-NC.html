<p>Although installation is easy and does not require much time, trying this task is not a good concept. Unless you have training and knowledge of HVAC systems, taking on the installation might trigger damage or installation mistakes that result in greater energy bills and bad system efficiency. Furthermore, HVAC systems have warranties that require qualified technicians to perform installation. You could void the warranties by handling that job.<p>
<p>Energy effectiveness can be improved even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats. In water heater the thermostats control zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively block the circulation of air. In this case, the control system is very crucial to preserving an appropriate temperature.<p>
<p>Fights the hot days: Though most temperatures in Seattle are acceptably average, you can expect a minimum of one month during which temperatures will reach above 80 degrees. There were 45 days above 80 in 2015! Simply a few years back, Seattle saw a record temperature level of 103 degrees, and there have actually been plenty of long, dry, hot streaks since then. A central air conditioning system in your home suggests you have the power to adjust the temperature to a constant temperature when the heat gets excruciating.<p>
