<h3>Identifying Shoddy HVAC Ductwork in Harrisonburg VA</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to conserve energy.

The combination of these building and construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has actually resulted in a boost in indoor air problems. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor cosmetics air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential structures. The ASHRAE standards for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air dilutes indoor pollutants and helps exhaust them from the house.<p>

<h3>Heating And Air Conditioning Service in Harrisonburg VA</h3>

<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both inside and outside, particle matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are various sizes, but the ones to be most worried about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- because they can be breathed in. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outside PM, generated by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings through natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
