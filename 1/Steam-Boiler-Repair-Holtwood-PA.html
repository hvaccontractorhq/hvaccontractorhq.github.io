Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to set up a costly new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady in time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of material in a building as fairly the same physical product over time. In truth, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
