<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season environments where the temperature level is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump end up being inefficient in more extreme cold.

Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter.<p>
