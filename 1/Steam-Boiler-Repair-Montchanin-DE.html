<p>All homes require effective ventilation. There are some instances of furnace failure that tend to be more typical than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot light has been stressed out from usage.

If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal problem.
