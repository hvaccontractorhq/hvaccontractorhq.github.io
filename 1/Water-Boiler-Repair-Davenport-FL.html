<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particle matter is a mix of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke.

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This suggests that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product with time. In fact, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and comprehended as complicated systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
