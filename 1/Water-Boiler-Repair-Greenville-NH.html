<h3>Home Furnace in Greenville NH</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning units are determined in lots. This measurement is based upon the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 ton unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This implies a 4.5 load unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can likewise be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed through a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
