<h3>Boiler Repair and Water Boiler Issues in Reevesville SC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is linked to a remote condenser unit using refrigerant piping in between an indoor and outside  unit rather of ducting air straight from the outdoor unit. Indoor systems with directional vents install onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or suit the ceiling. Other indoor systems mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that brief lengths of duct manage air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the spaces.<p>
<p>The evaporator coil is probably frozen. The cause is generally an absence of air flow over the evaporator coil, which is caused by a plugged filter. Without air flow, moisture from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Turn off the AC system, let the ice melt, alter the filter, and attempt once again. If it still takes place, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely incorrect with the condenser coil.<p>
