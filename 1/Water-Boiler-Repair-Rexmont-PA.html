<h3>Warning Signs That You Need Furnace Repair at Rexmont PA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Mortgage and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government company, carried out a study in the 1990s to investigate two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it lowers energy expenses by improving air flow. After testing 33 houses in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no substantial enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve air flow or energy efficiency. In many cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced immediately after cleaning however returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>

For systems needing only a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than essentially all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many individuals.<p>

When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat.
