Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up simply a few years back.<p>

<h3>Air Condition Service in Smithfield KY</h3>
<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a little, inexpensive versatile tube) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and wear and is quickly punctured.<p>
<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair cost. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and very comprehensive in describing what services would be performed. Likewise Camryn offered fantastic customer service at the end of the appointment by describing precisely what he had actually done, the condition of our heat pump, furnace and tankless water heater. He made a few ideas of some maintenance tasks we might want to have actually done in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies employed by some in the industry.<p>
