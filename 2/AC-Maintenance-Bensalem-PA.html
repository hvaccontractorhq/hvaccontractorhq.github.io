<p>An undersize system won't have the ability to cool spaces down totally on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. Since it merely takes more electrical energy to run a larger system, a large-scale compressor likewise costs more to operate. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it shuts off before it has a possibility to flow the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the needed moisture. The outcome is a space that does not appear as cool as the temperature level indicates. In reality, the room can feel moist and clammy.<p>
