<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you need to watch out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your ac system can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
