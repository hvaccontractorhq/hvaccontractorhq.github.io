<p>An indoor air pollutant is a compound in the air that might affect the health of individuals who reside in the house. Contaminants could originate from outside the home-- such as an idling car engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon entering the house from the ground below. An air pollutant could likewise originate from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide from a faulty furnace, unstable natural compounds (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or damp carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, home cleaning, or personal care products. Germs and viruses, animal dander, and bug parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>People working in structures with bad IAQ may observe unpleasant or moldy smells or may feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that occur at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling exhausted. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more severe issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for instance, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been linked to IAQ issues. Talk to your physician about them if you have symptoms that are not going away or are getting even worse. However not all direct exposures cause symptoms, so there is no alternative to excellent building management.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential function in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and elimination of air from inside a building." Those procedures include generating outside air, conditioning it and mixing it with indoor air, distributing that air throughout the building, and moving some portion of indoor air exterior. If one or more of these processes are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
