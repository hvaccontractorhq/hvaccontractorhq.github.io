<h3>AC Service in Miami Gardens FL</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After company hours Erik still answered my calls to work out and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and answered my concerns as they were working. I never ever felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
