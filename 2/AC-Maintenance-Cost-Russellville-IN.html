<p>The function of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for resident comfort while controlling temperature level, humidity, and indoor air quality for personnel and developing security at reasonable energy costs. Your furnace has lots of parts that can impact the health and safety of you and your loved ones. Having a complete check of your furnace will provide guarantee that it is safe to run. Paragon Heating & House Comfort Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Evaluation of your furnace consists of a Health & Security Analysis, which examines the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide leaks and polluted breathing air), checks the pilot safety (surge threat), checks the high limitation (fire risk) and consists of a visual examination for other risks.

<p>Location the solar tank near the standard hot water heater. If the heat exchanger is internal to the storage tank, ensure that the glycol loop connections to the heat exchanger and the cold and hot water connections are available.
