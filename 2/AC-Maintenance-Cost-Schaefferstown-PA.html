As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outdoor temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why most people don't utilize this measurement much anymore.<p>

Mold does not require light to grow and can thrive in concealed or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Chances are there will be mold growing close by if a source of water or condensation can be found. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly tidy the location utilizing recognized health department suggestions.<p>
