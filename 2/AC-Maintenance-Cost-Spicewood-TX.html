Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if numerous registers were closed or the filter was blocked. If you have actually altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've resolved the issue.<p>
