<p>Your heating, air, and ventilation conditioning system (HVAC) function as a collection source for a variety of pollutants that have the potential to adversely impact your health-- impurities such as mold, fungis, bacteria, and extremely little particles of dust. Your heating and cooling contractor should examine and, if necessary, upgrade the building envelope. For example, he may seal spaces and fractures in the outer walls and attic flooring, or he might blow insulation into the walls, either of which might knock as much as 30% off your cooling and heating costs. Insulation might be a more reliable service to your cooling problems than replacing your devices.<p>
<p>Geothermal heat pumps can be easily integrated with existing systems such as conventional forced air or radiant flooring heating or can be set up in a new building.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
