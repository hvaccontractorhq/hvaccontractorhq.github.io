<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter environments where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should temporarily change back into the routine air conditioning mode to change the outside evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can heat up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will therefore have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
