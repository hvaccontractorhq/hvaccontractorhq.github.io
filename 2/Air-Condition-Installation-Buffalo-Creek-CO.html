<p>Indoor Air Quality Guide: Finest Practices for Design, Building and Commissioning is designed for designers, style engineers, contractors, commissioning representatives, and all other specialists interested in indoor air quality. Sources of formaldehyde in the home consist of structure products, smoking, household products, and using unvented, fuel-burning appliances, like gas stoves or kerosene area heaters. Formaldehyde, by itself or in combination with other chemicals, serves a number of purposes in made products.

<p>Not all sensing units work the same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.
