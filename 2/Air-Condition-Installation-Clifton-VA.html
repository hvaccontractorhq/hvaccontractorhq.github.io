<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the solution and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>It is common to presume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, fairly steady in time. This implies that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming bulk of the mass of product in a structure as fairly unchanged physical material with time.
