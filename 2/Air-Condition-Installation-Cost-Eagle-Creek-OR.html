<p>While pollutants commonly discovered in indoor air are accountable for lots of damaging effects, there is substantial unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of exposure are required to produce particular illness. People also react really differently to exposure to indoor air pollutants. Additional research study is needed to much better understand which health results happen after direct exposure to the average pollutant concentrations found in homes and which happen from the greater concentrations that occur for brief time periods.<p>
<p>Biological contaminants include bacteria, molds, mildew, viruses, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are lots of sources of these pollutants. Pollens stem from plants; viruses are transferred by animals and individuals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and home pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful allergen. It can end up being airborne when it dries. Polluted central air conditioning handling systems can end up being breeding grounds for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
