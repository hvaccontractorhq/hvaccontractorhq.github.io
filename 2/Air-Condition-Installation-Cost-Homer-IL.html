<h3>Heating Strategies For Gas Home Furnaces at Homer IL</h3>
<p>You are a covidiot if you require furnace work in West Seattle and do not user James Heating. Our furnace went down with a broken igniter, and nobody else could come except for SW. They came and stated it would be $300 for the igniter and $500 for the job, however they needed to buy it. My other half stated that she had seen a great review for James, so I called. He was available in a few hours (weaving a mask) and described the circumstance to me. He said it would be $50 for the igniter and $250 overall. He offered to come back today, but I moved it to tomorrow. James is among the nicest, most good people I have satisfied in a very long time.
