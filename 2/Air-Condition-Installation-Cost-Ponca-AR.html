If you have actually installed the parts shown and reinstalled the detach block, repowered the breaker, turned on the switch at the furnace, moved the thermostat to AC mode and reduced the temperature level listed below the indoor temperature level, and the unit doesn't fire up after 30 minutes, it's time to call a pro.<p>
