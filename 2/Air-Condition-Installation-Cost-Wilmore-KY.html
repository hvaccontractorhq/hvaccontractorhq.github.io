Porous materials, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furniture found in the basements that have actually been damp for over 24 to two days might end up being a source for mold development and need to be discarded. In some cases there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can grow in covert or seldom accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic.

Fix the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Thoroughly clean the location using established health department recommendations.<p>
