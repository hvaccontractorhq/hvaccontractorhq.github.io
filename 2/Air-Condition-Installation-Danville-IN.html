<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Simply this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He knew just what the problem was and fixed it very rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About 10 years ago my whole cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>As pointed out above, activating your brand-new under tile floor heating unit prematurely, before the mortar has cured, can trigger the grout to split or to not adhere correctly, and might void the guarantee of your mortar product. In some testing, even the tile cracked when the system was run before the substance had cured. And mortar manufacturers might refuse service warranty coverage if you do not follow their instructions.<p>
