<h2>How To Hire Professional HVAC Companies in Eldridge</h2>

<p>We are OPEN as an "Important Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds unbelievable, however furnace technicians typically discover that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be turned on. Look for a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heaters, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace too. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is securely attached-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be totally depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>Mark (owner) and team were great from start to finish. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. As soon as I chose to final move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Ton unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not just was the rate terrific but Mark headed out of his method to tailor a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to surface) to get my unit installed. I believe any future company related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
