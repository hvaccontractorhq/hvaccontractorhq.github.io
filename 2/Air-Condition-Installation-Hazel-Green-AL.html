Break outs in medical centers and nursing homes, where clients are immuno-weak and immuno-suppressed, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis. More than one case has involved outdoor fountains in public tourist attractions. The existence of Legionella in commercial building water products is highly under-reported, as healthy people require heavy exposure to obtain infection.<p>
