<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

If we do decide to provide automobile debit we would likewise have a choice of a single payment for the Service Agreement.  There should not be any reason your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
