<p>When the heatpump went out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was really practical in gathering information on the phone and supplying clear guidelines about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and provided clear interaction about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was professional and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>

The main route of exposure is through the creation of an aerosol impact, most frequently from evaporative cooling towers or showerheads. A typical source of Legionella in commercial structures is from poorly positioned or kept evaporative cooling towers, which often launch water in an aerosol which might go into neighboring ventilation consumption. Break outs in medical facilities and nursing homes, where patients are immuno-suppressed and immuno-weak, are the most typically reported cases of Legionellosis.
