<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 readily available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, low-cost versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand well to wear and tear and is easily punctured.<p>

Low-cost craftsmanship is normally substandard workmanship, and it never ever helps a company construct long-lasting relationships with clients.<p>
