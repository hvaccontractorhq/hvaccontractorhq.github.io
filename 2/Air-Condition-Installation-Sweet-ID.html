<p>The Majority Of Midtown Houston Tx consumers do not understand why their HVAC system is not working when they place a 24 hr emergency ac repair demand. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending on how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have an excellent idea of how thick the ice accumulation is in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to check your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you're in luck, that's more than likely your problem. If you discovered that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to thaw your air conditioning equipment. The simplest way to defrost your HVAC equipment is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous products, floor, wall, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings discovered in the basements that have been wet for over 24 to two days may become a source for mold development and need to be disposed of. Sometimes there is a musty odor but mold can not be seen. Mold does not need light to grow and can grow in covert or seldom accessed areas of your home, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a variety of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering materials consisting of carpet underpadding. If a source of water or condensation can be found, possibilities exist will be mold growing nearby. Repair the moisture problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Completely tidy the location utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
