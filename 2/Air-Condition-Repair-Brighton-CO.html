Such a tool must recognize the number of individuals impacted; define ages and task descriptions of involved workers; figure out where they lie within the workplace; suggest when the signs occur (time of day, day of week, and time of year); provide a list of particular health signs or health problems; recognize all devices operated in the office; indicate the kind of outside air pollution; and recognize potential sources of job stress.<p>
