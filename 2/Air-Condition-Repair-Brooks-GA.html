<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a qualified HVAC technician will be able to do. For example, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in expensive compressor failure, but a homeowner doesn't have the tools or abilities needed to inspect refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate air flow are necessary to a well-functioning system, but property owners lack the essential equipment for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy house owner, it's still needed to have an expert technician examine the system occasionally.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often emit toxins.) However, procedures such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outdoor air penetrating into a house. Subsequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
