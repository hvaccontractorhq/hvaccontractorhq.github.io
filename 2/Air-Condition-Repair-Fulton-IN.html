<p>Recent Review: I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier because the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician explained the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>As pointed out above, triggering your brand-new under tile floor heater prematurely, before the mortar has actually treated, can trigger the grout to split or to not adhere appropriately, and may void the guarantee of your mortar item. In some testing, even the tile cracked when the system was run prior to the compound had actually cured. If you do not follow their guidelines, and mortar makers may decline warranty coverage.<p>
