Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
