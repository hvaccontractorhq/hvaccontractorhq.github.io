<p>Have actually utilized the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
