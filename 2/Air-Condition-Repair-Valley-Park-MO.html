<p>Heating is the biggest energy cost in the average home. In really dry climates, evaporative coolers, in some cases referred to as swamp coolers or desert coolers, are popular for improving coolness during heat. An evaporation cooler is a device that draws outdoors air through a wet pad, such as a large sponge soaked with water. The practical heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature level of the inbound air is minimized, however it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. A few of the practical heat of the going into air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. The outcomes can be rather considerable if the going into air is dry enough.<p>
