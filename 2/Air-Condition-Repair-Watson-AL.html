<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel often gets requests for consultation and help in dealing with indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. The possibility of immediate responses to indoor air contaminants depends on several factors including age and preexisting medical conditions. In many cases, whether an individual reacts to a contaminant depends on private level of sensitivity, which differs greatly from individual to person. Some people can end up being sensitized to biological or chemical pollutants after repeated or high level exposures.<p>
<p>The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is devoted to offering a work environment that is devoid of acknowledged threats and to investigation complaints that might be associated with bad indoor air quality (IAQ).

<p>So it ended up that everything they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'automobile oil change' type of maintenance as I have actually read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely little bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' trigger a problem in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
