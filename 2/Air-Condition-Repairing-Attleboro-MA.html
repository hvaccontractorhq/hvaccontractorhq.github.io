<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the detach next to the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature below the room temperature level, and then change it ON. To avoid straining an a/c unit's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on.

<p>Brian was every bit truthful, enjoyable and responsive.
