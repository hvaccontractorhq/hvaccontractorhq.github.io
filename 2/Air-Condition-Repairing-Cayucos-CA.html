<h3>The Way to Get the Best Gas Furnace For Your Home in Cayucos CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Real Estate Corporation (CMHC), a government firm, performed a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy costs by improving airflow. After testing 33 homes in Montreal prior to and after duct cleaning, the research study discovered that there was no considerable enhancement in air quality which duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy effectiveness. In some cases, measured particle levels actually increased right away after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels reduced right away after cleaning but returned to previous levels within weeks.<p>
