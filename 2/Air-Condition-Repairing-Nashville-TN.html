<p>It is common to assume that structures are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a structure as fairly the same physical material with time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be deemed the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the built environment thinking about the dynamic system of structures, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
