<p>All contemporary cooling systems, even small window bundle systems, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like product, and need to be replaced or cleaned as conditions require. For instance, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will require to have the filters altered more frequently than structures without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as needed will add to a lower heat currency exchange rate, leading to lost energy, reduced devices life, and higher energy costs; low air flow can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can totally stop air flow. In addition, really unclean or plugged filters can trigger overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>Installation involves digging deep holes or long trenches to install the pipes, so it's labor-intensive on the front end.
