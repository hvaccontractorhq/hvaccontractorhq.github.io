<p>Terrific Product! Delivery was kind of weird being that the box was opened and items might have fell out. However after review of contents we assured it was all intact. The item was exceptionally lite weight and takes some time to apply. Keep in mind: purchase recommended non motified mortar and additional corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to adjust the shower flooring and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. , if you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.. We had problems with air bubble pockets. After getting in touch with support, we resolved concerns. I would suggest this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Adding in a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench quickly.<p>
<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous service provider since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician invested a decent quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
