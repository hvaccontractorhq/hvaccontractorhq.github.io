<p>Your ventilation, air, and heating conditioning system (HVAC) act as a collection source for a range of contaminants that have the possible to adversely impact your health-- pollutants such as mold, fungi, germs, and very little particles of dust.

If monitoring data is not available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative need to request that the employer have air monitoring tests conducted. Evaluation of this data may identify possibly harmful sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when impurity concentrations are extremely low, keeping an eye on data might not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
