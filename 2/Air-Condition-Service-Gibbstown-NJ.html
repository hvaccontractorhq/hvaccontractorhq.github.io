<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either due to the fact that of visible development or a musty odor consistently originating from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also present wetness. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, think about having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You ought to have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use automobile debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of money being available in every month, it helps with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to provide vehicle debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There should not be any reason that your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
