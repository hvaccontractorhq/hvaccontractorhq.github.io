Improper change, often shown by a persistent yellow-tipped flame, triggers increased contaminant emissions. Ask your gas company to adjust the burner so that the flame tip is blue. If you buy a brand-new gas stove or range, consider purchasing one with pilotless ignition due to the fact that it does not have a pilot light that burns constantly. Never ever use a gas range to heat your house. Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>
