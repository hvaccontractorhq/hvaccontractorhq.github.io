<p>As a number of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is required by all major equipment producer's to ensure your factory service warranties stay in location. Furthermore, the concrete results of a PM is typically difficult to measure, as one response stated the savings in efficiency or repairs that were avoided. A lot of pieces of a furnace or a/c unit don't simply break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the result of repeated use of a component that runs out balance. For example, a heat exchanger might stop working too soon due to the fact that the gas pressure was running to high, preparing the metal and triggering early wear and tear, resulting in cracks and holes. If that customer had actually received a PM year to year the contractor will guarantee their gas pressure stays in line and secures the element.  a very advantageous outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a client thousands.<p>
