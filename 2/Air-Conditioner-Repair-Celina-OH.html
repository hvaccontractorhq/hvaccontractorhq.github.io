A lot of house heating and cooling systems, consisting of forced air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local bathroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
