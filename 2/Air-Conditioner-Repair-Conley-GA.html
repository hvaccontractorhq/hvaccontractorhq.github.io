<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Stability was extremely handy in gathering details on the phone and offering clear directions about how to temporarily deal with the issue and prepare the heatpump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future avoidance. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd expected, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for workplace and home.<p>
