<p>Current Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My air conditioning system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they supply.<p>
