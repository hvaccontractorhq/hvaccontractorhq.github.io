<p>All Points Heating uses house cooling, a/c installation, ac system maintenance that deliver reputable, proven performance at high efficiency. Combustion items from auto exhaust, heaters, hot water heater, area heating units, fragrant candles, oil lights, wood ranges, fireplaces, and gas stoves that are not correctly vented can create carbon monoxide gas, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, and respirable particulates. These combustion products may result in eye, throat, and nose inflammation; tiredness; dizziness; and nausea.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an exceptional task finding the outdoor unit as near your home as possible per my demand. The job took 2 days and my yard and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very well-informed of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 year old furnace.) He stayed up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>

<p>When the heatpump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Integrity was extremely valuable in gathering information on the phone and offering clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next early morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely efficient and offered clear interaction about the issue, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will definitely utilize Integrity Energy Systems again, for office and house.<p>
