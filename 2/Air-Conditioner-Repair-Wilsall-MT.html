<p>If you think a mold problem-- either because of visible growth or a moldy smell consistently coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it doesn't remove the mold. Mold begins with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can keep and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also introduce wetness. Again, if you think a mold problem, consider having a service company inspect the duct system for leakages.<p>

<p>Wow - just wow. I never ever have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta offer whoever dreamed that one up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one inside your home and never ever needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual and even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 except the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up instead of purchase something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I guess they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>

<p>As a lot of you pointed out, preventative maintenance is needed by all significant equipment maker's to ensure your factory service warranties remain in place. Additionally, the concrete results of a PM is often difficult to measure, as one response mentioned the savings in efficiency or repairs that were prevented. Many pieces of a furnace or air conditioner do not just break at the snap of a finger, however rather is the outcome of repetitive usage of an element that runs out balance. For instance, a heat exchanger may stop working too soon since the gas pressure was operating to high, cooking the metal and causing premature deterioration, resulting in cracks and holes. If that client had received a PM year to year the contractor will ensure their gas pressure stays in line and safeguards the element.  an extremely beneficial outcome and one that was no cost at the time of service, but one that potentially saved a customer thousands.<p>
