<h3>Heat Pumps and Indoor Air Quality in Cerro NM</h3>
<p>Another approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air contaminants in your house is to increase the amount of outside air coming indoors. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating unit, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your home. Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather permits, or running a window air conditioner with the vent control open boosts the outside ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen area fans that tire outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the space where the fan lies and likewise increase the outdoor air ventilation rate.<p>
