<p>Free cooling systems can have really high performances, and are sometimes combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter season can be used for summer season cooling. Common storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with small storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heatpump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (rather than charging) mode, triggering the temperature to gradually increase during the cooling season.<p>

Many times, these units contain not just the air conditioning unit itself but also a furnace. An advantage of this system is undoubtedly the cost. Packaged systems are great for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system separately, because the system is combined. However, one con is that these units are normally just offered for bigger homes due to their high power and capability. Additionally, while they can be a good way to save cash on a complete HVAC system, they're still substantially more costly than buying just a cooling system. Therefore, this might not be the very best option for property owners trying to find short-term savings or those with smaller spending plans.<p>
