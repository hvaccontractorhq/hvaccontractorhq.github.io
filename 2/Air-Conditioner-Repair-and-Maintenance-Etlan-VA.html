<p>Recent Review: They were terrific! Many HVAC companies focus simply on upsell and forget to provide you with the service initially requested. They fulfilled my needs totally by supplying an expert quote with options, without pressing extra items. The crew showed up on time, kept me notified as they worked, and completed a little early. The also quickly followed up with the necessary inspections from the city. And in the end, I have a high quality AC and furnace. I highly recommend this company.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is regularly in the variety of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heat pumps become ineffective in more severe cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To compensate for this, the heat pump system should briefly change back into the regular a/c mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to make up for the short-term indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be unpleasant in the winter season.<p>
