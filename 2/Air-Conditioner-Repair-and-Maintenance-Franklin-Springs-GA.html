<h3>HVAC Installation Near Me in Franklin Springs Georgia</h3>
<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much great if it does not get rid of the mold. Mold starts with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are not likely to be the source. The most likely perpetrators are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can preserve and inspect. Leaking return ducts can also introduce moisture. Once again, if you believe a mold problem, think about having a service company examine the duct system for leaks.<p>
