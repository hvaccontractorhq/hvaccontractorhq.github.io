<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy extended service warranties or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to offer me something I don't need.<p>
