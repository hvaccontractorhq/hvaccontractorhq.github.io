<h3>Things to Do Before You Turn In Your Air Conditioner at Mason OH</h3>
<p>We found Jake and Adam to be wonderful, and were very pleased that somebody as skilled as Adam was able to fix the air and return conditioner. We had actually purchased the club member maintenance plan, which assisted balance out the high cost of repair (around $1500.) Our suggestion to any homebuyers: hire Blue Flame to test the a/c prior to you purchase. We purchased this home in February, so it was too cold to turn on the AC then, however Adam stated he had methods to evaluate AC systems even in winter season. We want we had understood him then.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is sometimes called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (completely or partly) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will trigger fresh, outdoors air to be provided to the system. When the outdoors air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is frequently performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
