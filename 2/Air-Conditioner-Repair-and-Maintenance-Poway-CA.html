<p>To say there are a lot of variables in installing solar water-heating systems would be an understatement. Place the air conditioning system back into its initial box, utilizing the dense-foam packing material to secure it from damage.

<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. When I have concerns, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new main system and double zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never ever buy prolonged warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Excellent financial investment in my opinion. Never attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
