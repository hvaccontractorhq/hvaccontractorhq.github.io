<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Timnath CO</h3>
<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wished to share my experience. You don't prepare for having to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long method. Other companies would arrange a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my alternatives. After business hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family pal and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
