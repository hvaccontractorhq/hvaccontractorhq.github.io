<p>Poor indoor air quality is normally brought on by the lack of adequate ventilation, which leads to a buildup of impurities from sources in the home. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified insufficient ventilation as the main problem in more than half the workplace indoor air investigations it has carried out.

These investigations exposed that correct ventilation is essential in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>The majority of trustworthy HVAC professionals will offer free estimates with an in-person service call.

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning assistance identify the effectiveness of dilution.
