<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both fantastic. Just this morning I noticed I had no heat. I called him, and he came by the exact same day. He understood simply what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. However here is the BEST ONE. About 10 years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so truthful, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>

<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning units is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a conventional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The common set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temp of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Central air is a luxury not everyone can pay for, a lot of Seattleites need to discover ways to fight the heat without a duct system. Last year the city spread word of more than 70 cooling centers in libraries, senior centers, and beaches in reaction to a heat advisory from the National Weather Service. On the other hand, in huge box shops like Best Buy, the box fans and window AC units are nabbed up as quickly as they're stacked in floor display screens. Seattle might be the last city in the nation to face the truth of a cruel, cruel summer.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioning conditioner, you might choose to change the outdoor compressor with a contemporary, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, consult a local heating and cooling contractor to ensure that the new compressor is properly matched to the indoor unit. However, considering current changes in refrigerants and air conditioning styles, it might be wiser to replace the entire system.<p>
