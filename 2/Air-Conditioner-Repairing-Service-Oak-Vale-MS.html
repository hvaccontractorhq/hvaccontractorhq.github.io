The procedure repeats itself and is switched on and off by a pre-set thermostat. Fuel for these forced-air convection furnace systems is normally oil or natural gas, however some are electrically powered too.<p>
<p>Both the evaporator and the condenser are sealed. Therefore, a professional service individual ought to be called for almost any maintenance other than routine cleaning. Central air conditioners should be professionally examined and adjusted before the start of every cooling season. Nevertheless, do not let your maintenance end with this yearly examination.
