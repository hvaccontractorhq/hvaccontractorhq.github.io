<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have multiple control boards. The biggest, or just one in some heating systems, is in some cases called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, however the new control panel need to be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t effectively identified, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a professional to detect.<p>
<p>Have actually utilized the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. When I have problems, they give me priority and a lower rate. Bought a new main system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy prolonged guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never attempt to offer me something I do not require.<p>
