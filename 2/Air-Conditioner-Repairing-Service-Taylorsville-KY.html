<p>Radiant heat covers a series of different heating systems, consisting of electric heaters and boilers. Boilers are the most common, though all radiant heating systems operate on similar principles. In the case of a boiler, the system heats up by distributing warm water through a series of pipelines installed in the sub-floor of each space. In the case of electric radiant heat systems, this is done by running an electrical current through heating components. As the warm water (or electricity) moves through the subfloor, it radiates warm up through the flooring and into the room.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 came into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in brand-new systems. The Policy banned using R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
