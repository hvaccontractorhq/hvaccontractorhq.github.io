Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go clean and outdoors off the condenser coils (Photo 2). If several registers were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased air flow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Auto" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually resolved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
