<p>When the heat pump headed out in our offices, Taylor at Integrity was very useful in collecting info on the phone and supplying clear directions about how to briefly handle the problem and prepare the heat pump for effective repair the next day. Levi was out the first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was extremely effective and used clear communication about the problem, its solutions, and its future prevention. The repair was quick and cost less than I 'd prepared for, and the service was friendly and professional. And, the work area was left cleaner than when Levi started. I will certainly utilize Stability Energy Systems again, for workplace and house.<p>
<p>Weatherization typically does not trigger indoor air issues by adding brand-new toxins to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes produce pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can lower the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air contaminants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>This evaluation is for replacing a 17 years of age AC with a brand-new AC, humidifier, air filtration system and thermostat. The technician who described our options did an excellent task in making sure we comprehended the pros and cons of each option. The professionals who set up the brand-new system were professional and fast, while taking time to ensure we comprehended how the brand-new system worked. Overall a very first rate experience.<p>
