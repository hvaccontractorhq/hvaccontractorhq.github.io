<p>Immediate results might show up after a single exposure or repeated exposures. These include inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such immediate results are normally short-term and treatable. Sometimes the treatment is simply getting rid of the individual's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Signs of some illness, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise appear soon after exposure to some indoor air contaminants.<p>

More than one case has actually involved outdoor water fountains in public destinations. The presence of Legionella in commercial structure water supplies is highly under-reported, as healthy people need heavy direct exposure to obtain infection.<p>
