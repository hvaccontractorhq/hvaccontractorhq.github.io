<p>Weatherization normally does not cause indoor air issues by adding brand-new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often produce toxins.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can reduce the amount of outside air penetrating into a home. Consequently, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>After the system has actually been looked for leaks, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipe insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers must be insulated with fiberglass pipeline insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that comes with fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunshine can be protected by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside should be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
