Each space in the home has possible asthma triggers. Some problems can be fixed quickly, but others might need more time and work to control or get rid of asthma activates. Easy-to-fix issues, such as chemical odors and fragrances, contribute to indoor air contamination and have been understood to asthma signs in sensitive people.

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the house can increase.<p>
