<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually set up. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing.

<h3>Things to Know Before Getting a HVAC Contractor in Surprise AZ</h3>
<p>So it turned out that everything they did was 100% assessment, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a really little bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'could' trigger an issue in the future. So he stated I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. Either way it was going to be the exact same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>Strategy how you will broaden your client base over the years to stay profitable, although at first, you might begin your HVAC service with limited threat. Start out part time with a set amount of hours you would like to operate in your organisation. For instance, you might want to work four hours each weekend and then expand it to include a four more hours for three or four days during the week. Recognize the number of clients you can service within a week based on the hours you would like to dedicate to business and your monetary objectives.<p>
