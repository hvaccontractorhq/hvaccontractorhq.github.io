<h3>How to Install a Duct Fan to Lower Heating and AC Bills in Aldrich MO</h3>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a relatively simple to measure surrogate for indoor pollutants released by people, and correlates with human metabolic activity. Co2 at levels that are unusually high indoors might cause occupants to grow sleepy, to get headaches, or to operate at lower activity levels. Outside CO2 levels are typically 350-450 ppm whereas the optimum indoor CO2 level considered acceptable is 1000 ppm. 28 Humans are the primary indoor source of carbon dioxide in the majority of buildings. Indoor CO2 levels are a sign of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor resident density and metabolic activity.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Make sure all the registers in your home are broad open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If a number of registers were closed or the filter was clogged, the decreased airflow could have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the signs up. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for at least thirty minutes or up until there's good airflow at the signs up. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you have actually solved the problem.<p>
