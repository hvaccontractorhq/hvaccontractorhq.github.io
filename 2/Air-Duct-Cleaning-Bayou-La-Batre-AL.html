<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had actually installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the auto debit, although my company does not provide auto debit lots of companies do so they can have a known amount of money coming in each month, it helps with cash flow and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use car debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There must not be any reason your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>
