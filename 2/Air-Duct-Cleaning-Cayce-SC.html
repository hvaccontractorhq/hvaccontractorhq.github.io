<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are frequently described as simply radiant systems. Electric radiant heat systems have heating elements installed in the subfloor of each room in the home, sometimes linked to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your home. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the floor, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
