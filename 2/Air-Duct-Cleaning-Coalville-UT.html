<p>Find Out About PSR Mechanical. The efficiency of an air cleaner depends upon how well it gathers toxins from indoor air (revealed as a percentage effectiveness rate) and how much air it draws through the cleaning or filtering aspect (revealed in cubic feet per minute). A very effective collector with a low air-circulation rate will not be effective, nor will a cleaner with a high air-circulation rate but a less effective collector. The long-lasting performance of any air cleaner depends upon maintaining it according to the manufacturer's directions.<p>

<p>If you suspect a mold issue-- either because of noticeable development or a musty smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much good if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can maintain and inspect. Dripping return ducts can also present moisture. Again, if you suspect a mold issue, consider having a service company check the duct system for leaks.<p>
