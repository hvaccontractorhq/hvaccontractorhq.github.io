<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's simple to believe that the air quality outside is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and smell exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck spew thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are frequently 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outside levels of the same pollutants. To put it simply, often the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>Geothermal HVAC systems are becoming typical features of environmentally friendly homes as part of the growing green building motion.

That's approaching 30 to 40 percent of the whole housing market.<p>
