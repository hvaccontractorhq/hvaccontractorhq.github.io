<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being kept at a set temperature level (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (say to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioner gets rid of that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "efficiency" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the ac system has a coefficient of performance of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to make up for this, therefore making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>

<p>EER means Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The typical set conditions are outside temperatures of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people do not use this measurement much anymore.<p>
<p>Numerous AC units include a number of unique features that can even more improve efficiency and effectiveness.

The protein in urine from rats and mice is a potent allergen. When it dries, it can become airborne. Polluted central air handling systems can end up being breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological impurities and can then disperse these contaminants through the house.<p>
