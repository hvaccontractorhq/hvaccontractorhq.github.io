The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health identified inadequate ventilation as the main issue in majority the work environment indoor air examinations it has actually conducted.

<p>An indoor air toxin is a substance in the air that might affect the health of individuals who live in the house. Contaminants could come from outside the house-- such as an idling cars and truck engine in an attached garage, yard garbage burning, or radon going into the house from the ground listed below. An air toxin might likewise come from inside the house-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a faulty furnace, volatile natural substances (VOCs) from a newly painted room, pre-owned smoke, mold growing on damp or wet carpets, or chemicals from hobbies, family cleaning, or individual care items. Viruses and bacteria, pet dander, and insect parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air contaminants.<p>
