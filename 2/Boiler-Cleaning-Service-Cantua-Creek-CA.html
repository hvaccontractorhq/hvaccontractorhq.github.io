<h3>The Way to Choose An Expert HVAC Tech in Cantua Creek CA</h3>
<p>The Canada Home Loan and Housing Corporation (CMHC), a government company, conducted a research study in the 1990s to examine two claims: Duct cleaning makes indoor air healthier; and it minimizes energy expenses by improving airflow. After evaluating 33 houses in Montreal before and after duct cleaning, the study discovered that there was no significant enhancement in air quality and that duct cleaning alone did not improve airflow or energy efficiency. Sometimes, measured particle levels in fact increased immediately after a cleaning. In other cases, particle levels decreased immediately after cleaning but went back to previous levels within weeks.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am really happy with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was excellent. He gave me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to discuss everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they offer.<p>
