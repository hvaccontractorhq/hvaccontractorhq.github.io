<p>Another approach to reducing the concentrations of indoor air toxins in your home is to increase the quantity of outdoor air coming inside. A lot of home heating and cooling systems, including required air heating systems, do not mechanically bring fresh air into your house. Opening doors and windows, operating window or attic fans, when the weather allows, or running a window air conditioning unit with the vent control open boosts the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or cooking area fans that tire outdoors get rid of impurities straight from the room where the fan is located and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>

No additional charge.<p>
