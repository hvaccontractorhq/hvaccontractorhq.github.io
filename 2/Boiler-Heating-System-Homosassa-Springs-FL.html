<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have yearly maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Concerning the vehicle debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money coming in each month, it assists with cash flow and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do decide to use automobile debit we would also have an option of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.  There ought to not be any reason that your company can not offer this. Hope this helps.<p>
