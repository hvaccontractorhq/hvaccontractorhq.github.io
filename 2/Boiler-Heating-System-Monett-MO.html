<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you must examine your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little ridiculous, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if totally iced over.<p>
