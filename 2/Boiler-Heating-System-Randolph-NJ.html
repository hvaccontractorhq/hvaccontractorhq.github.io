He knew simply what the issue was and fixed it really quickly. But here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my whole air conditioning and gas heat went totally dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so sincere, he could have charged me for so much more.<p>
