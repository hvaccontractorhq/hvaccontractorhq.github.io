<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many furnaces have multiple control boards. The largest, or only one in some furnaces, is sometimes called the Motherboard. The circuit boards manage and collaborate the operation of the motors, sensing units, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the brand-new control panel must be installed exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the issue isnâ $ t effectively identified, altering a board wonâ $ t repair it, and boards are not returnable when set up. Itâ $ s a good idea to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
