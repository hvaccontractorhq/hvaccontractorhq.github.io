<p>Indoor air pollution originates from a range of sources; the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has actually determined structure products, home furnishings, and mold as serious concerns, but much of the risk also comes from burning things. For example, cigarette smoking or burning wood for heating or cooking can develop pollution in houses that can threaten the health of those who live there. This is a particularly big concern in the establishing world.<p>
