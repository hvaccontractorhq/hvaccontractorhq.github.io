<p>I normally do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not anticipate having to replace your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me go with this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional reviewing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I scheduled my install and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will recommend this company to my buddies.<p>
