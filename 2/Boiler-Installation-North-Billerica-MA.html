<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your North Billerica MA Home</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of exchanging or changing air in any space to supply high indoor air quality which includes temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and elimination of moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne bacteria, co2, and other gases. Ventilation eliminates unpleasant smells and extreme wetness, presents outdoors air, keeps interior building air flowing, and prevents stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the main panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature, and then switch it ON. To avoid straining an air conditioner's compressor, wait a minimum of five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. If the fan isn't turning, look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this).<p>
