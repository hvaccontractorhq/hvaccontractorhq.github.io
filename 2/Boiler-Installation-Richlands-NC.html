Although he didn't have actually the required replacement part in his van, he changed his schedule so he might try to find and purchase it the next early morning. Less than 24 hours after I called him, I was definitely thankful to have a heated home again. What's most remarkable was that this all occurred during Thanksgiving week! I wasn't sure we 'd find somebody to help us right before a holiday, but Climate Pro came through for us. I will gladly advise this company to my buddies.<p>
<p>When setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones, the main problem. While setting up a separate split system, workers try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Setting up a multi-split system develops more troubles, since a few of indoor units can be situated far from the outside. The first models of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each room. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor units operate separately from each other.<p>
