<h2>How To Hire Certified HVAC Company in Hoagland</h2>
<p><img src="https://hvacimage.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/hvac.jpg" alt="" width="1002" height="403"><p>
<p>Proper ventilation helps improve indoor air quality. It's easy to think that the air quality exterior is even worse than the air quality inside. We know about air contamination and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air contaminants are typically 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels, and in many cases these levels can surpass 100 times that of outdoor levels of the exact same contaminants. To put it simply, sometimes the air inside can be more hazardous than the air exterior.<p>
<p>A blocked furnace filter can trigger a furnace to shut off. Unclean filters are the most common cause of furnace issues. Dust and dirt restrict airflow-- and if the filter gets too stopped up, the heat exchanger will shut and get too hot off too rapidly, and your house won't heat up. Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also causes soot buildup on the heat exchanger, reducing the efficiency of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>
