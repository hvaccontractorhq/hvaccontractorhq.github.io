<h3>Tips To Help You Repair Your Own Furnace in Reva VA</h3>
<p>Your lungs are accountable for bringing fresh air into your body, while simultaneously eliminating waste gases and particulates. Needless to say, the more particles that are in the air you breathe, the more difficult it is for your lungs to remove them. Poor air quality - whether it is inside or outdoors - can make it increasingly challenging for your lungs to function correctly, and can have negative health impacts.<p>
<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outside air damper and close (completely or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be provided to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be met without using the mechanical supply of cooling (typically cooled water or a direct expansion "DX" unit), hence saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature level of the outside air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often done in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outdoors air must be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
