Infants, children, and fetuses are more vulnerable to lead direct exposure than grownups considering that lead is more easily taken in into growing bodies, and the tissues of children are more sensitive to the destructive results of lead.

<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He put in the time to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was polite and experienced. I was charged a fair price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
