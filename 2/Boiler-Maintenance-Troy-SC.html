<h2>How To Hire Residential HVAC Company in Troy</h2>

If your contractor says they know the size of air conditioning unit you need based on experience or on square footage alone, move to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of an unit needed based on BTUs, determining the right size of system for your house also depends upon the system load-- just how much cold air it will lose by room.<p>
