<p>Watch out for indications of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, ceiling, wall, and floor coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to 48 hours might become a source for mold development and should be discarded. Sometimes there is a moldy smell but mold can not be seen. Mold does not require light to grow and can flourish in concealed or hardly ever accessed areas of your house, such as behind walls or in the attic. In addition, mold can grow on a range of surface areas: in the HVAC system, behind wallpaper, on sheetrock or ceiling tiles, and on floor covering products consisting of carpet underpadding. Possibilities are there will be mold growing nearby if a source of water or condensation can be discovered. Repair the wetness problem, either by locating the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the area. Completely clean the area utilizing recognized health department recommendations.<p>
