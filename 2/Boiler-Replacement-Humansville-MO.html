<p>There are 116 highly-rated local air duct cleaners. On the day of the visit he was here for about 2 hours, much of that time he invested educating me about our system, and left having solved the problem with an easy repair he did on-site, not changing the whole part. He was friendly, uncomplicated and a thoroughly enjoyable person to have around that whole time. His time and competence to RESOLVE the problem cost us less than what we paid the other company simply to do a somewhat unpredictable diagnostic.<p>
<p>Scott carried out the installation and did an outstanding task locating the outside system as near to the house as possible per my demand. The task took 2 days and my backyard and basement were left tidy throughout and after the work. Scott was very educated of the system, performed a very clean installation with the existing ductwork, and walked us through the new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.) He remained till 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the job was finished on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
