<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Noise given that 1978. The choice of indoor systems has one restriction: their total power needs to not exceed the capacity of the outdoor system. In practice, however, it is very common to see a multi-split system with a total capability of indoor systems higher than the outside capability by a minimum of 20%. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to anticipate much better efficiency when all indoor systems are switched on at the exact same time, because the overall capacity of the whole system is limited by the capability of the outside unit. Simply put, the outdoor system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces may not have a very comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not simple, given that it takes into consideration not only the small power of the units, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>

<p>Radiant heating unit do not utilize ducts, that makes them quite a bit more energy effective than other systems. They also don't produce cold and hot areas.
