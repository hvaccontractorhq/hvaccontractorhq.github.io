<p>Recent Evaluation: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioning unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and replaced the part and whatever works great now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call prior to coming out and gotten here on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was educated and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>

<p>Second, identification of pollutant sources is typically crucial to figuring out the cause( s) of worker health signs. Such details can often be gotten by requesting copies of air monitoring data from the company. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high number of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative need to ask for that the employer have air tracking tests performed. Evaluation of this data might determine potentially dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. Nevertheless, when contaminant concentrations are extremely low, monitoring data may not discuss the observed or reported health signs.<p>
