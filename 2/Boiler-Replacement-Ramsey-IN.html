Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to try to optimize the operation to save energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control requires systems to be set to provide makeup air at lower temperatures (design levels), instead of the higher temperature levels in some cases utilized to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions.
