<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to complete. I 'd priced out brand-new systems and installation for months. When I chose to last progress in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Heap unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was stated and done. Not only was the rate fantastic however Mark headed out of his method to customize a few things in my home to make the overall air flow more optimized.

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Just take a picture of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may need a recommendation in the future). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the port and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've swapped all the wires, protect the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5).<p>
