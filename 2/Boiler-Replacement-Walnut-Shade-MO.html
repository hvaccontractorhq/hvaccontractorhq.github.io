<p>Due to the existing Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your home at maximum efficiency will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will need a much larger AC system than a smaller home, which will affect installation expenses. Also a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air flow will need far less AC capability to keep temperature levels comfortable. Other factors that can impact this could be the insulation elsewhere such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>An AC contactor is a $25 mechanical relay that uses low-voltage power from the thermostat to change 220-volt high-amperage existing to the compressor and condenser fan. AC contactors can wear and are at the top of the list of typical air conditioning service failures. Even if your AC contactor is working, it pays to replace it every 5 years or so. Unscrew the old AC contactor prior to eliminating the wires. Then move the wires to the new system (Image 6).<p>

Using existing ductwork will get rid of the requirement to set up a pricey new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
