<p>Terrific Product! Shipment was sort of weird being that package was opened and products could have fell out. However after review of contents we ensured it was all undamaged. The item was very lite weight and takes some time to use. Keep in mind: purchase advised non motified mortar and extra corners if you have a window. We used the Kerdi as recommended to the height of the shower head and had to change the shower floor and curb to fit. Make sure to see the video first prior to installation and follow all directions exactly. If you have any issues call the Schluter Kerdi call center.  We had issues with air bubble pockets. After contacting support, we dealt with problems. I would suggest this product to anybody who's remodeling or installing their bathroom for the first time. Including a Schluter Kerdi triangle bench soon.<p>
