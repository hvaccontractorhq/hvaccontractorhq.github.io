<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE recommends temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer season; indoor relative humidity needs to be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold growth.<p>
<p>When the furnace senses that the burner has actually reached a high enough temperature, a blower fan will begin to present air to a heat exchanger. The heat exchanger allows air to be warmed without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner location. Once it reaches a sufficient temperature, the air warmed by the heat exchanger is then required through the house's duct, providing warm air to individual bed rooms, living rooms and kitchen areas through the vents or signs up.<p>
