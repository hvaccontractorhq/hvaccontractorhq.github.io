Incorrectly located outdoor air consumption vents can also bring in air contaminated with auto and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from restrooms.

PTACs, which are regularly used in hotels, have two different systems (terminal packages), the evaporative unit on the interior and the condensing unit on the exterior, with an opening going through the wall and linking them. This decreases the interior system footprint and enables each space to be adjusted independently. PTAC systems might be adapted to offer heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to heat the interior and draw heat from the exterior air, transforming the air conditioning unit into a heatpump While room air conditioning offers optimum versatility, when used to cool numerous rooms at a time it is normally more pricey than central air conditioning.<p>

You can, however, hide the condenser in the landscaping, as long as air can freely circulate around it.<p>
