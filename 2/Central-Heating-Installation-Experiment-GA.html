<p>Chemical pollutants: Unpredictable organic compounds ( VOCs) are organic chemicals. VOCs are various, varied, and common. They consist of both human-made and naturally occurring chemical compounds. Chemical contaminants can consist of tobacco smoke, emissions from products used in the building (e.g., workplace equipment; wall, floor and furniture coverings e.g. formaldehyde; and cleaning and customer items) unintentional spill of chemicals, and gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, which are items of combustion.<p>

According to the EPA, while homes without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with inadequately changed gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher.
