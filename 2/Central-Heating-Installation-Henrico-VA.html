<p>The instructions that came with the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfy finishing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left installing the brand-new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrician. We suggest you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable heats up.

Then call the family together and play a game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
