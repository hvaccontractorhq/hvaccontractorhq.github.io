<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered into force in 2000 and prohibited the use of ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Regulation banned the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance in between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid). This means that equipment that utilizes R22 can still operate, as long as it does not leakage. Although R22 is now banned, units that use the refrigerant can still be serviced and maintained.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Servicing in Manteca CA</h3>
<p>A split a/c system might cost near to that of a traditional HVAC system but has actually proven to be an alternative cost effective alternative to houses that do not have ductwork. Used together with other forms of heating or cooling, such as portable or window air conditioning unit, area heating systems, or oil heating systems, it can enhance the comfort of your house while keeping your regular monthly utility expense reasonable.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually installed both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have discovered them to be reasonably priced, timely and do fine work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the entire plenum and the duct work for the hot water heater since the service technicians thought they just didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that way. No extra charge.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Due to the fact that the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly little 2x4-foot closet, they use up simply 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest using "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive flexible tube) rather of stiff square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it does not stand up well to wear and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
