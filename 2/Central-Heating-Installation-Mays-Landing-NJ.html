<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you wouldn't provide them.  Second of all like extended vehicle warranties they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks do not have the needed skills to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with clients fairly. As a client you need to be well informed in order not to be totally benefited from. Many companies would rather sell you a brand-new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Finally found someone to correctly service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the previous 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
