<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician described the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
