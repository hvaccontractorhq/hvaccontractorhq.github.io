<p>Indoor air quality (also called "indoor ecological quality") describes how within air can affect an individual's health, convenience, and ability to work. It can consist of temperature level, humidity, lack of outdoors air (bad ventilation), mold from water damage, or exposure to other chemicals. Presently, OSHA has no indoor air quality (IAQ) standards but it does offer standards about the most common IAQ work environment complaints.<p>
<p>Ventilation: Reducing pollutant concentration by using cleaner (outdoor) air to dilute contaminated (indoor) air. Local building regulations most likely define the amount (and in some cases quality) of outdoor air that should be continually supplied in your structures, as do voluntary standards set by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHREA). Momentarily increasing ventilation coupled with correct use of the exhaust system while painting or using pesticides, for example, can be beneficial in diluting the concentration of toxic fumes in the air.<p>
