The heatpump unit sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas via a duct system. If your house or building has an existing duct system that is in good shape, a ducted heat pump system might be most budget friendly. Utilizing existing ductwork will eliminate the need to install an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Cooling can likewise be supplied by a process called free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is added due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, thus decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
