<p>Free cooling systems can have very high efficiencies, and are in some cases combined with seasonal thermal energy storage so that the cold of winter can be used for summer air conditioning. Typical storage mediums are deep aquifers or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter, heat-exchanger-equipped boreholes. Some systems with little storages are hybrids, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added-in due to the fact that the storage serves as a heat sink when the system is in cooling (as opposed to charging) mode, triggering the temperature to slowly increase throughout the cooling season.<p>
