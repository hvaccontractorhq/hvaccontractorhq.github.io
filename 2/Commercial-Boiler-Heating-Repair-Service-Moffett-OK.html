He had a replacement motor on the truck, and changed it within an hour. I myself was likewise in the service call company several years earlier and understand the significance of having the right parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.

<p>After the system has been looked for leakages, thoroughly insulate all of the glycol and water lines. Water piping can be insulated with basic foam pipeline insulation. Glycol piping and external heat exchangers need to be insulated with fiberglass pipe insulation. Duct tape can be used on the joints of the water piping insulation, and use the joint tape that includes fiberglass piping insulation. Insulation exposed to sunlight can be safeguarded by a foil wrap, or UV resistant paint. Fiberglass insulation used outside must be safeguarded with PVC insulation covers.<p>
