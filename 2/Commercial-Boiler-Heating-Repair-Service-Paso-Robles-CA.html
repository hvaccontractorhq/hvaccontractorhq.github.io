<p>Truth: Earth loops can last for generations. The heat-exchange equipment generally lasts decades, because it is secured inside. When it does require to be replaced, the expense is much less than putting in a whole new geothermal system, since the loop or well is the most expensive to set up. New technical standards eliminate the concern of thermal retention in the ground, so heat can be exchanged with it forever.
