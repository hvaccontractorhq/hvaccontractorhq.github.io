<p>Using a stove hood with a fan vented to the outdoors significantly reduces direct exposure to pollutants throughout cooking.

Constantly ensure the flue in your gas fireplace is open when the fireplace is in use.<p>

<p>Ducts running in closets use up less space than you may believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a fairly small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend using "flex duct" (a little, low-cost flexible hose) instead of stiff square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to tear and use and is quickly punctured.<p>
