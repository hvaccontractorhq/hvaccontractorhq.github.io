<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is updated every four years. The Principles Handbook consists of heating and cooling computations. The design expert should seek advice from ASHRAE information for the requirements of design and care as the typical building codes offer little to no information on HVAC style practices; codes such as the UMC and IMC do consist of much detail on installation requirements, however.

<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just 8 to 10 years old, it could flatter twice the electrical energy that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's due to the fact that it runs at or below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy required to supply a particular cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum allowed by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling costs than equipment set up simply a few years earlier.<p>
