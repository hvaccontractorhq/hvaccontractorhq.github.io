<p>SysTech Design concentrates on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) beneath the coils guarantees dirt does not build up and get drawn into the system. It likewise prevents water from collecting on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
