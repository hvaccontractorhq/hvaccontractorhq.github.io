<h3>Assessing the Performance of Your HVAC System in Jeffersonville IN</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run constantly is due to the fact that something is dirty or clogged up Prior to attempting to repair any problem, take time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan". If the air filter is good to go, check the furnace blower for blocking and clean it. If this does not work, take a look at the furnace blower motor and oil it. Get in touch with a skilled technician if you still can not figure out why your furnace keeps running.<p>

<h3>HVAC Installation in Jeffersonville IN</h3>
<p>For a heated floor area less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from a nearby GFCI-protected outlet without straining the circuit. (If the thermostat you buy is currently GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad should be GFCI secured.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and nuisance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are offered.<p>
