The same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to stay with and develop on the coils.

It likewise prevents water from building up on and below the coils, which can cause mold problems.<p>
