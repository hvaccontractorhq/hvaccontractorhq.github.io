<p>EER stands for Energy Performance Ratio. The energy effectiveness of central air conditioning systems is determined by the variety of BTUs the temperature drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As pointed out above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.
