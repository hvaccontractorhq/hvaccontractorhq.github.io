<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, but lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and consumption of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for functions of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of steady occupancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in offices a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 should be calibrated regularly, and outdoor measurements used for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature level impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be essential.<p>
<p>Weatherization normally does not trigger indoor air issues by including brand-new contaminants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can in some cases emit toxins.)
