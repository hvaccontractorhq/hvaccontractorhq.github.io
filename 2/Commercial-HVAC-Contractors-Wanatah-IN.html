<p>Biological impurities include germs, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, house dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; infections are sent by people and animals; germs are brought by individuals, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household pets are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from rats and mice is a powerful irritant. When it dries, it can end up being airborne.
