<p>Mark (owner) and group were wonderful from start to finish. I 'd evaluated new systems and installation for months. Once I decided to last move forward in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark wound up hooking me up with a 3 Load unit and by far beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when everything was said and done. Not only was the rate excellent but Mark headed out of his way to personalize a couple of things in my home to make the general air circulation more optimized. I think it literally just took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros method.<p>
