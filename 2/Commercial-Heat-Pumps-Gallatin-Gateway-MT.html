<p>Information offered in this security guide is based on existing scientific and technical understanding of the concerns presented and is reflective of the jurisdictional boundaries established by the statutes governing the co-authoring agencies. The standards do not need you to change your existing central air conditioning units, and replacement parts and services must still be offered for your house's systems. The "life-span" of a central air conditioning conditioner is about 15 to twenty years. Manufacturers typically continue to support existing devices by making replacement parts offered and honoring maintenance contracts after the brand-new standard goes into effect.<p>
<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent task locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my backyard and basement were left clean throughout and after the work. Scott was extremely educated of the system, carried out a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to disassemble our old oil furnace (we decided to keep it for my parents' rental house that has a 80 year old furnace.) He remained up until 7pm on a Friday night to make sure the task was completed on time. We were up and running with AC for the weekend.<p>
