<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
