<p>SysTech Design concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for enhancing and keeping the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The same applies for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it distributes through your house. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and build up on the coils. Likewise, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It likewise avoids water from collecting on and below the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
