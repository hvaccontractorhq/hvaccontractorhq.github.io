<p>I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 technicians I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance procedure. The fix at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
