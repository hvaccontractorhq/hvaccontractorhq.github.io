<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious element impacting indoor air quality, but it is often used as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more residents there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is launched into the air. To avoid CO2 levels from increasing too high-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outside air should be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
