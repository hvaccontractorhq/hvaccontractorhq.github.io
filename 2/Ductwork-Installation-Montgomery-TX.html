<p>Today, countless allergen, dead skin cells, building debris, and mold may be living in your home's air ducts, impacting the air you breathe along with the effectiveness of your heating and a/c system. Indoor air quality isn't on the majority of people's radar. Only 9 percent of Americans consider it a hazard to their health, and 70 percent aren't worried about it at all, according to a current study by the Consumer Reports National Proving Ground. However a number of the things people do-- or do not do-- can add to the stew of air-borne pollutants in their homes and get worse asthma, allergic reactions, and other health conditions.<p>
<p>Central air conditioners are more effective than room air conditioning unit. In addition, they are out of the method, quiet, and hassle-free to operate.

In an average air-conditioned home, air conditioning consumes more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, triggering power plants to discharge about 3,500 pounds of co2 and 31 pounds of sulfur dioxide.<p>
