<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the danger of respiratory infection; there is also proof from animal studies that repeated direct exposures to raised nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. Individuals at specific risk from direct exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of kids and individuals with asthma and other respiratory diseases.<p>
