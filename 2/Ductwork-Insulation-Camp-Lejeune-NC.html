<p>Now, there are a couple of typical indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to look out for. Initially, you must inspect your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, however ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
