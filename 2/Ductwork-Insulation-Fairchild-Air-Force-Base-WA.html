<h3>Ductless Heating And Cooling in Fairchild Air Force Base WA</h3>
<p>I usually don't leave evaluations however wished to share my experience. You don't expect having to change your AC unit. Sadly for us, we had no other option. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still answered my calls to negotiate and go over choices. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my concerns as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their method. We were referred by a family buddy and now I will recommend this company to my pals.<p>
<p>Heat pumps are a dream become a reality for folks in Seattle.

<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while discussing whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working effectively. He had to go get the proper replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
