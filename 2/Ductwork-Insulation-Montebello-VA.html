<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous provider because the 2 technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time finding the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
