<p>Indoor air quality (IAQ) refers to air quality in indoor office, classroom or laboratory environments, rather than outside or industrial settings. In jobs where union subscription is not a problem, an HVAC technician might complete the assembly and installation of the ductwork that distributes the heated or cooled air from the HVAC system. This consists of cutting the sheet metal to form the ducts, attaching the ducts to the HVAC system, and mounting the ductwork in the structure. It may also include the installation of registers where the ductwork connects to specific areas.<p>
<p>The term radiant heating covers a number of different system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are often referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects set up in the subfloor of each room in the house, sometimes connected to terminal units like baseboard heaters. When the system remains in use, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating elements throughout the house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is referred to as radiant heat.<p>

<p>Current Review: I am very pleased with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the issue and changed the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c and servicing the furnace. He was experienced and courteous. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they supply.<p>
