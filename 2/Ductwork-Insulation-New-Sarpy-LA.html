<p>To the HVAC owner who said they break even on service contracts - cut me a break. If they weren't lucrative you wouldn't offer them.  Second of all like prolonged automobile guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service attempt to upsell you which is really unfortunate. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the task and also the morals to treat consumers fairly. As a customer you require to be well notified in order not to be completely taken advantage of. Most companies would rather sell you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the unit you have.

Finally discovered somebody to appropriately service and the system has been running problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
