<p>COVID-19 UPDATE: Our professional cleaning and sterilizing services are classified as a Necessary Service in Los Angeles. Today's furnaces are rated 90% effectiveness or better; it is not uncommon for a modern-day furnace to be ranked 94 or 95% efficient. Compared to older designs, which may be rated as low as 80% efficiency, this can mean significant cost savings in annual heating expenses. Modern 2- and three-stage heaters increase effectiveness even further by performing at lower or greater capability depending upon the heating requirements of the location.<p>
<p>A Trane air conditioner can range in price from $4,000 - $10,000. Our rates guide discusses all the aspects that affect your rate. The cost of your air conditioning system will vary depending upon the size of your house, design you pick, special installation requirements - even where you live and the climate in your location. You can reduce your costs thanks to local rebates, special deals and tax credits To get the most precise price for your house, schedule a house evaluation with your local dealer.<p>
