<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>Aerating or ventilation (the "V" in HVAC) is the process of changing or exchanging air in any space to provide high indoor air quality which involves temperature level control, oxygen replenishment, and removal of wetness, odors, smoke, heat, dust, air-borne germs, carbon dioxide, and other gases. Ventilation gets rid of undesirable smells and excessive wetness, presents outside air, keeps interior building air flowing, and avoids stagnation of the interior air.<p>
<p>There are numerous variables that add to indoor air pollution. Such aspects include the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas given off by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from developing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>
