<p>Considering that the 1980s, manufacturers of HVAC equipment have been making an effort to make the systems they make more efficient. This was originally driven by rising energy costs, and has actually more recently been driven by increased awareness of environmental issues. Furthermore, improvements to the HVAC system effectiveness can also assist increase occupant health and productivity. 21 In the US, the EPA has actually enforced tighter limitations over the years. There are several approaches for making HVAC systems more effective.<p>
<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this type in the yards of houses. With split system units, most of the parts are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts too. Split systems are ideal for cooling numerous rooms simultaneously, but are not really energy efficient. Therefore, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this might spend more money on cooling expenses in the long run because of the lower energy efficiency.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) might not be the most pernicious aspect affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically used as a surrogate for air quality and structure occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or structure, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have an unfavorable impact on residents-- outside air needs to be deliberately brought into the structure through a ventilation system.<p>
