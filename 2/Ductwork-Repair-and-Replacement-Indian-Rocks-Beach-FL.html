<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap but a quick web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating costs, so I happily had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace stopped working.

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it might flatter twice the electricity that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Until 2006, 10 SEER was basic, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up just a couple of years earlier.<p>
