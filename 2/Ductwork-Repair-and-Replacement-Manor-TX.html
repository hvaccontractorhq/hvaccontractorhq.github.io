<p>All houses need efficient ventilation. There are some circumstances of furnace failure that tend to be more common than others. If your furnace kicks on however the air it expels is cold, it could be that your pilot burner has been burnt out from use. Another possible reason could be a broken thermostat, avoiding the furnace from adjusting to the right temperature. Furnaces that kick on frequently may be due to a dirty filter, which is not enabling the furnace to cycle air appropriately. If your furnace is making a lot of racket when it switches on or is humming, there might be an internal issue. While humming is brought on by a slipped belt in the internal operations, other sounds such as knocking and banging can be from parts requiring to be oiled or perhaps a dirty burner.<p>
