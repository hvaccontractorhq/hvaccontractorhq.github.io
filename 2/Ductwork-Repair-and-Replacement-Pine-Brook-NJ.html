<h3>The Benefits of Regular HVAC Maintenance in Pine Brook NJ</h3>
<p>Replaced a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Effectiveness (97%) Phoenix Light Duty 50 gallon water heater. It went great. Working with Braxten was an enjoyment. We got a quote for 3 various water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high efficiency tank. The crew took the whole day as they needed to remove the old hot water heater and install all new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heater. We chose getting something more expensive than a traditional hot water heater as gas is among our most significant utility costs. We feel that this brand-new unit will last a long time and use extremely little energy to heat water.<p>
