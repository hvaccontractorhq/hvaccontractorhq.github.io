<p>We are OPEN as an "Essential Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds astounding, but furnace professionals often find that the only "repair" a furnace needs is to be switched on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one someplace. Examine the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Ensure the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly fastened-- there's a push-in switch under it that must be fully depressed for the furnace to run.<p>
<p>For example, problems develop when, in an effort to conserve energy, ventilation systems are not used to bring in appropriate amounts of outdoor air. Insufficient ventilation likewise occurs if the air supply and return vents within each space are blocked or placed in such a way that outside air does not actually reach the breathing zone of structure occupants. Incorrectly located outside air intake vents can also bring in air contaminated with automobile and truck exhaust, boiler emissions, fumes from dumpsters, or air vented from bathrooms. Finally, ventilation systems can be a source of in door contamination themselves by spreading biological impurities that have actually increased in cooling towers, humidifiers, dehumidifiers, a/c unit, or the within surface areas of ventilation duct.<p>
