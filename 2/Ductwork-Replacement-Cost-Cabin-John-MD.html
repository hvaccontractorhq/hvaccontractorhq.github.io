The sensible heat of the incoming air, as measured by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is decreased, but it is also more damp, so the overall heat (sensible heat plus hidden heat) is the same. A few of the practical heat of the entering air is converted to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the entering air is dry enough, the results can be rather significant.<p>

Jamey Stephens of Evergreen House Heating and Energy has watched the single-family home installation company entirely flip on its head the last few years. Winter utilized to be the hectic season for the South Park contractor. Now it's the summertime, with their traditionally two-week AC installation wait times ballooning to as much as 3 months. It's been a cultural shift," states Stephens, a Pacific Northwest native. Both with the climate and individuals." And not simply with newcomers more accustomed to AC living. Longtime Seattle property owners are lastly giving up, he says, paying $5,000 to $10,000 to retrofit homes with air-cooling systems.<p>
