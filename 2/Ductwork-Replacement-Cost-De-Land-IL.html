<p>How environment change affects air quality and direct exposure to air toxins. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being maintained at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for contemporary air conditioning system) needs that the rate of energy removal by the air conditioner boost. This boost has the effect that, for each system of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the air conditioning system eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioner must increase its power intake by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the quantity of power dissipated into the system. As an example, assume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating component is activated, and the air conditioner has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, hence making the 100 W heating element cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
