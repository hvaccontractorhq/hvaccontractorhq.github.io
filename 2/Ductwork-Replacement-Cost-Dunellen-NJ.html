Radiators can be locally located in one location like a restroom flooring or be set up across the whole sub-surface of the house's floorings. Other radiators are still utilized, such as wall-mounted panels or baseboard heating systems-- although ceiling radiators are almost always used in commercial applications like warehouses.<p>

The only method to know if there is lead in drinking water is to have it tested. Contact the local health department or the water provider to learn how to get the water tested. Send for the EPA handout, Lead and Your Drinking Water, to learn more about what you can do if you have actually lead in your drinking water. Call EPA's Safe Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791) for more information.<p>
