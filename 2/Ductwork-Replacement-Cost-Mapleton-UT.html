<h3>HVAC Duct Cleaning in Your Mapleton UT Home</h3>
<p>The icing issue ends up being a lot more severe with lower outside temperature levels, so heatpump are frequently installed in tandem with a more conventional type of heating, such as an electrical heating system, a gas, oil or tree fireplace or central heating, which is used instead of the heatpump throughout harsher winter temperature levels. In this case, the heatpump is used efficiently during the milder temperature levels, and the system is changed to the standard heat source when the outdoor temperature level is lower.<p>
<p>Because an air conditioning system moves heat in between the outside coil and the indoor coil, both must be kept tidy. This suggests that, in addition to replacing the air filter at the evaporator coil, it is also essential to frequently clean the condenser coil. Failure to keep the condenser clean will eventually result in harm to the compressor, since the condenser coil is responsible for releasing both the indoor heat (as picked up by the evaporator) and the heat produced by the electric motor driving the compressor.<p>
