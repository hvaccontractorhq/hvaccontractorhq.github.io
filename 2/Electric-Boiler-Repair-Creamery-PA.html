<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized unit, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate. An oversize compressor likewise costs more to operate due to the fact that it just takes more electricity to run a larger system. And an oversize unit does not lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts down before it has a possibility to circulate the appropriate volume of air past the coils to extract the essential moisture. The outcome is a space that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In reality, the room can feel wet and clammy.<p>
