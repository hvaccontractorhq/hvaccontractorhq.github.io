Then be sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The decreased air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several registers were closed or the filter was blocked. Deice the A-coil if you have actually changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or until there's good air flow at the registers.
