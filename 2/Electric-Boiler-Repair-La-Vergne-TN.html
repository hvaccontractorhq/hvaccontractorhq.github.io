<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you ought to check your air conditioner for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little unreasonable, however ice on your ac system can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air.

If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
