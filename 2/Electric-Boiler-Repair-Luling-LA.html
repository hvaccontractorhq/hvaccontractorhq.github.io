<p>When they put a 24 hour emergency ac repair request, the majority of Midtown Houston Tx customers do not know why their HVAC unit is not working. If your evaporator coil is frozen, the copper lines at the outside unit we'll be frozen too. Depending upon how thick the ice accumulation is at your condensing unit, then you'll have a good concept of how thick the ice accumulation remains in the evaporator coil. The very first thing you need to do is to inspect your conditioning filters. If your filter is dirty, you remain in luck, that's probably your problem. If you found that your conditioning filter requires replacing, then the next action is to defrost your a/c equipment.
