<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually brought on by the absence of sufficient ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of pollutants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Security and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the main problem in over half the work environment indoor air investigations it has performed. Investigations conducted in homes by the Illinois Department of Public Health have actually found the exact same to be true. These examinations revealed that proper ventilation is very important in maintaining good indoor air quality.<p>
<p>This is especially significant, as gas ranges can cause levels of contamination that would be illegal outdoors. According to the EPA, while houses without gas ranges have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), houses with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and homes with badly changed gas ranges can be 30 ppm or greater. This is well in excess of the 9 ppm in the EPA's standards.<p>
<p>Nick B. supplied extraordinary, personalized, attentive, and quality service. His communication style gets along, efficient and appealing. He clearly and completely discussed all issues and repairs in a manner that made me confident in his capability to resolve my repair issues. He followed through and went above and beyond to personally get a needed part that was not in stock, making sure repairs were made so that my wife and I would not need to endure another night without heat, during one of the coldest winter seasons in recent memory. He also reacted to my call instantly the next morning, and coached me through a temporary fix to an issue that could not be resolved on the very first see due to not available parts. I rely on Nick's abilities, experience and capability to provide consistent, quality service.<p>
<p>Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the main reason for indoor air quality issues. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not generating adequate outside air to water down emissions from indoor sources and by not bring indoor air pollutants out of the location. Heat and humidity levels can likewise increase concentrations of some contaminants.<p>
