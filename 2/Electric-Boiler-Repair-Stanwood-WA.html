<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is VITAL TO protect the performance and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, choose your contractor sensibly, a lot of the 'respectable' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to improper sales tactics that DO benefit from uninformed house owners. Again, consider the source, Angie's list is a paid site with an agenda. While Angie's list is an excellent base line indication that you MIGHT be dealing with a trustworthy company, you still should do your research (not all contractors with a similar score are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you ought to inspect your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat correctly.<p>
