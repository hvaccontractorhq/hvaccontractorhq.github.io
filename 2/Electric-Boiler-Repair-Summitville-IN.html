<p>Cooling can likewise be offered by a procedure called free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled area.

Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore declining its efficiency.<p>
