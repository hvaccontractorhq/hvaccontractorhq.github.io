<p>Due to the present Coronavirus epidemic and lockdowns, we wish to help keep your home's Indoor Air Quality at its best. The ability to cool and heat your house at maximum performance will depend a lot on how well insulated your house is currently and the size of your house. A 2500 square foot home will require a much bigger AC system than a smaller house, which will affect installation costs. Likewise a house with energy effective windows that are well insulated and sealed well without any cracks for air circulation will require far less AC capability to keep temperatures comfy. Other factors that can impact this might be the insulation somewhere else such as the foundation, roofing system, attics, basements, flooring, and more.<p>
<p>When trying to figure out how frequently I must change my air conditioning filters, there are numerous things to take into factor to consider. Every Houston Heights 77007 77008 home has a special DNA on how it accumulates dust and dirt. It takes about 6 months of close observation to see how typically your air conditioning filter collects dirt and dust. After that, you can make a much better ideal decision on how often your HVAC filters need changing. Some Houston Midtown 77003 77004 houses have more than one HVAC filter, like townhouses. The more air filters you have in your Houston Galleria 77055 77056 77057 home, the less frequently you'll need to clean them. Houston Montrose 77006 77098 homes with just one a/c filter need replacing more frequently.<p>

<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping between an indoor and outdoor  system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit.

Next, examine other elements of the furnace for any build-up of dirt, dust and particles, a low-cost repair that can help improve performance. Also, check the vents and ducts for blockage.
