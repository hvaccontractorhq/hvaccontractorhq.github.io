These combustion products might result in nose, throat, and eye inflammation; fatigue; lightheadedness; and nausea.<p>
<p>In a split-system central air conditioning conditioner, an outdoor metal cabinet contains the condenser and compressor, and an indoor cabinet contains the evaporator.

If your house already has no air but a furnace conditioner, a split-system is the most affordable central air conditioner to set up.<p>
