<p>If you think a mold problem-- either since of noticeable development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts won't do much good if it does not remove the mold. Mold begins with a moisture problem, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely culprits are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep.

<p>This is my third time utilizing Around the Clock. Ilan constantly makes himself readily available - whether it's a heating concern in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more routine calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is proficient with these gadgets).

<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to change your filters regularly, they're not joking. It's as vital as a routine oil change in your automobile.

Additionally, a fresh, tidy filter better traps pollutants and particles in the air. When every three months, Energy Star recommends changing your filter. During high use months, inspect the filters at least monthly.<p>
