<p>SysTech Design focuses on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control approach for enhancing and maintaining the quality of the air in and around an industrial environment. The exact same holds true for the evaporator coils inside your house's cooling system. Evaporator coils cause condensation, dehumidifying the air prior to it flows through your home. Condensed moisture can trigger dust and other particles to stick to and develop on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) underneath the coils guarantees dirt doesn't develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Issues. HVAC systems can likewise exacerbate indoor air quality issues. The HVAC system might be polluted (because of mold in duct lining or germs on coil or filters, for instance), and the system may spread these toxins throughout the home.
