HVAC specialists recommend following this basic rule when choosing whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the system is more than 6 years of ages, and the repair will cost majority the cost of a new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>

<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is simply 8 to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical energy that even a low-end brand-new one would use.

Up until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, but these days, the minimum enabled by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling expenses than equipment set up just a couple of years back.<p>
