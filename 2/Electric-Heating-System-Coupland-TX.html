Set the thermostat to a temperature below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an a/c's compressor, wait at least 5 minutes between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You ought to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>
