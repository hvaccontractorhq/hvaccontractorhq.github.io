<p>You're probably hearing the fan motor trying to start without the boost it requires from the capacitor if you hear clicking that is followed by a hum or buzz. You can often conclude that the capacitor has actually stopped working.

Air-side economizers also use outside air to condition areas, but do so utilizing fans, ducts, dampers, and control systems to present and distribute cool outside air when suitable.<p>
