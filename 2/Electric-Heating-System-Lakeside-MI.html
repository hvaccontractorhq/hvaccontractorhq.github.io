<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a requirement for air conditioning system repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you should check your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
