<p>On the other hand, you have 100% control over whom you employ to install your central air conditioning system. In truth, you can even DIY, regardless of our strong suggestion not to do so. Anticipate to pay between $300 and $1,000 in labor costs to set up central air if you do take our suggestion. In addition, cooling contractors might charge an extra $50 to $200 for extra materials and equipment.<p>
<p>To the HVAC owner who said they recover cost on service agreements - cut me a break. If they weren't profitable you would not provide them.  Secondly like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover extremely little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the annual service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. A lot of folks lack the necessary abilities to do the task and likewise the morals to deal with consumers relatively. As a customer you need to be well informed in order not to be totally taken advantage of. Many companies would rather offer you a brand-new AC of furnace than to correctly service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the same pitch to sell brand-new versus repair. Lastly found somebody to effectively service and the system has actually been operating problem complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
