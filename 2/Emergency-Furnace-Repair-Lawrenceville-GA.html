<p>Cooling can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to circulate a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heat pump to chill the flow originating from the storage. The heat pump is included due to the fact that the temperature level of the storage slowly increases throughout the cooling season, consequently decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
