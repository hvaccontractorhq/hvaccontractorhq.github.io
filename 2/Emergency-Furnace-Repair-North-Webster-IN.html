<p>Are you including a brand-new room onto your home? Maybe you have a room with distinct heating and cooling challenges, such as rooms that always appear to be too hot or too cold. That's where ductless Air conditioners come in! Likewise known as mini splits" or split level Air conditionings," ductless ACs can be set up in your house without all the pesky ductwork that features conventional HVAC systems.<p>
<p>This is particularly significant, as gas stoves can trigger levels of pollution that would be unlawful outdoors. According to the EPA, while homes without gas stoves have CO levels from 0.5 to 5 parts per million (ppm), homes with well-adjusted gas stoves have levels that can range from 5 to 15 ppm, and houses with inadequately adjusted gas stoves can be 30 ppm or higher.

Research suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels may present risks, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air containing radon.

EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths annually in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. Your threat of lung cancer is especially high if you smoke and your house has high radon levels.<p>
