(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the floor heating pad need to be GFCI protected.) However a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may likewise accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and problem circuit breaker trips. For our larger mat, we chose to set up a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are readily available.<p>
