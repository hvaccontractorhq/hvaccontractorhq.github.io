<p>RMI is working to change that, starting in California. As a first step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor guidelines based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor home appliances through codes, and after more powerful guidelines are set there is an opportunity to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Immediate impacts might show up after a single direct exposure or repeated exposures. These consist of inflammation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, lightheadedness, and fatigue. Such instant impacts are treatable and normally short-term. In some cases the treatment is merely eliminating the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be identified. Signs of some illness, including asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might also show up not long after exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>Generally the most effective way to enhance indoor air quality is to get rid of private sources of contamination or to lower their emissions. Some sources, like those that contain asbestos, can be sealed or enclosed; others, like gas ranges, can be gotten used to decrease the quantity of emissions. In many cases, source control is likewise a more cost-effective method to protecting indoor air quality than increasing ventilation because increasing ventilation can increase energy costs. Specific sources of indoor air pollution in your house are listed later in this area.<p>
<p>Also, there are natural causes for indoor air pollution. For example, humans breathe out carbon dioxide, which in small amounts is not harmful, however may become hazardous if high concentrations are allowed to accumulate. Micro-organisms or germs may also be present within the ventilation system. They might spread throughout the entire workplace or structure by ways of the ventilation system if micro-organisms do develop.<p>
