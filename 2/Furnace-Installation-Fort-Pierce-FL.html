<h3>HVAC Maintenance in Fort Pierce FL</h3>
<p>Central air systems are determined in tons. This measurement is based upon the unit's capability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 load system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in heaps, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This suggests a 4.5 ton unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it implies the amount of energy needed to heat a pound or cool of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning units utilize capacitors to begin the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat informs it to switch on. In time, capacitors can wear, and when they do, you'll see the motor running hotter. Before that occurs, you want to get those capacitors changed to avoid additional damage to your system.<p>
