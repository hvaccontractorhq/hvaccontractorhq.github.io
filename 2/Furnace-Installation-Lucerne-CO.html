<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heat pump. The system runs quietly and effectively, but to have two major parts stop working in 3 1/2 years doesn't speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These costs were listed on the billing prior to work began. Parts were covered by service warranty. Tax included another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>

<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You must have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really small passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Regarding the car debit, although my company does not use auto debit numerous companies do so they can have a recognized amount of money being available in monthly, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" throughout the slow times of the year. If we do choose to use automobile debit we would likewise have an alternative of a single payment for the Service Contract.  There need to not be any reason your company can not use this. Hope this assists.<p>
