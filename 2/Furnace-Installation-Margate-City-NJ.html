<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend utilized in automobiles in the U.S. up until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12.

For systems needing only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and carrying out far much better than virtually all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "low-cost" by many individuals.<p>

Using existing ductwork will remove the need to set up a costly brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
