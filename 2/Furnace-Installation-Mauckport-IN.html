<p>Indoor temperature levels are in some cases more tough to control than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperature levels ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter season, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summertime; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid identify the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to remove wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to supply adequate changes to ensure a healthy environment. There are numerous types of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A typical aspect needed in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers assistance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
