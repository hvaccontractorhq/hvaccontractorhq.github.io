<p>Some systems include an "economizer mode", which is often called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (totally or partially) the outdoors air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outdoors air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will enable the need to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" unit), therefore conserving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is regularly performed in climates where humidity is more of a problem. In both cases, the outdoors air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to get in the economizer mode.<p>
