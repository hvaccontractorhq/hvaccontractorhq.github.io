<p>4 Seasons has actually set up both of my furnaces and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the annual maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they went well beyond what was needed and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater because the service technicians believed they simply didn't appear best and they couldn't leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
