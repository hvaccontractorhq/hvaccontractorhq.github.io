<h3>Advantages of Servicing Your Central Heating Boiler in Brookpark OH</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil change' type of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had a very small bubble on the surface which the tech said 'could' cause an issue in the future. So he stated I might switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In either case it was going to be the same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>There are several variables that contribute to indoor air pollution. Such elements include the use of chemicals like formaldehyde in carpets and furniture; carbon monoxide gas released by cigarette smoke and outside traffic; polychlorinated biphenyls included in electrical transformers; radiation from constructing insulation; ozone from photo copiers; and solvents used in cleaners, glues, copiers; and the ventilation system itself.<p>

<p>I have actually been using them for years for my companies, my own houses and my real estate clients' homes. I went through five other companies before I found Luis at Protex Convenience Control.

Luis was the sixth person, who discussed to me completely the problems which didn't cost me as much. When the AC stopped working at my rental house, another occasion. When I called and he encouraged me to call service warranty which I did which didn't cost me a dime to have the system working once again, he helped me difficulty shoot the problem. He is truthful, trustworthy, and affordable on price. It's tough to find a truthful AC person and I'm happy I found Luis. Extremely advise Luis and his company.<p>
