The name is a trademark name owned by DuPont for any chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant. The refrigerant names consist of a number showing the molecular structure (e.g., R-11, R-12, R-22, R-134A). The blend most utilized in direct-expansion house and structure comfort cooling is an HCFC known as chlorodifluoromethane (R-22).<p>

Without airflow, wetness from the air will collect on the evaporator coil and freeze. Shut off the AC unit, let the ice melt, change the filter, and attempt once again. If it still happens, call the HVAC technician, since something is most likely wrong with the condenser coil.<p>
