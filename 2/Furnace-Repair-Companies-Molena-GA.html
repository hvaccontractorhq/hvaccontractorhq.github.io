<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for ac system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you must check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if completely iced over.<p>
