<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% examination, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I have actually checked out here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface area which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I could switch it out now or leave it and have it replaced when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never ever broke).<p>
<p>By contrast, according to Roddy Scheer and Doug Moss of Scientific American, the uniform heat distribution over the whole surface of a floor warms the lower half of the space, enveloping residents in warmth at a lower total temperature level-- in some cases up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit cooler-- than a conventional heating system." In other words, in-floor heater provide a different mode and level of convenience. And, as numerous public awareness projects have long advised us, the more comfortable we feel, the more inclined we might be to nudge down our thermostat, in turn lowering our energy expenditures.<p>
