<p>Instead of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. Due to the fact that approximately 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit might be lost to leakages in your ducts, a ductless system has a built-in effectiveness benefit. Ductless heatpump are terrific for additions due to the fact that they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Because an unit is installed in each space or location you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you are present.<p>
