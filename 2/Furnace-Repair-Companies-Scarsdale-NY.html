<h3>Air Conditioning Service in Scarsdale NY</h3>
<p>You're motivating the growth of mold in moist air if you set it too low. The heat dries out the air, preventing mold growth and pollution. Obviously, too-dry air can also aggravate your lungs and sinuses, while too much indoor humidity can add to the growth of germs and viruses, according to a 2018 study in the International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health. The perfect humidity in a home is around 50 percent, according to the American Lung Association.<p>

<p>Your Review This is my third time using All the time. Ilan always makes himself offered - whether it's a heating issue in the middle of the night in the depth of winter season to more regular calls like a malfunctioning Nest thermostat (he is proficient with these devices). I have absolutely nothing however excellent things to state - he has taken good care of my heating and AC requirements. Quick reaction - fast resolution.<p>
<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you should examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioning unit can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat appropriately.<p>
