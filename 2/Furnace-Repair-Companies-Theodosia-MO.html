<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtration. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter frequently in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more sophisticated electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some basic maintenance. These filters help with indoor air quality by trapping air-borne toxins streaming through your system. They can also keep your system performing well by helping reduce the buildup of dust, dirt and other particles from collecting on internal elements like the blower motor, burners and heat exchanger.<p>
<p>EER means Energy Efficiency Ratio. The energy efficiency of central air units is measured by the number of BTUs the temperature level drops per hour divided by the inputting watts in a set range of conditions. As mentioned above, a BTU is a standard unit of heat; it is specified as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. The normal set conditions are outdoor temps of 95 ° F and an indoor temperature of 80 ° F with 50% humidity, which is why the majority of people don't utilize this measurement much any longer.<p>

<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications result from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. Air cleaning takes place when particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to get rid of moisture. The goal is to offer enough changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be installed to achieve this. A typical component required in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side drawing in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Style.<p>
