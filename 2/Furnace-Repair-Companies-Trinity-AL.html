<p>Volatile natural substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to poor indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both indoors and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from products or procedures; for the many part, you can smell their existence. Common sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning representatives, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more.

Sources of VOC contamination from outside could include unstable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
<p>Practically half of Americans utilize air fresheners at least once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that regularly, our nationally representative study found. Roughly 40 percent hardly ever or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area variety hood, though they utilize it daily. One quarter have never ever cleaned or changed their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in the house or let others smoke there. All of those things can aggravate indoor air quality.<p>
