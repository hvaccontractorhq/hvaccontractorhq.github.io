<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Dirty condenser coils will not give off heat efficiently and will keep the unit running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outside run relay may have bonded together-- something that can happen gradually because of regular electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to examining the run relay, shut off the power to the furnace and the condensing unit. Next, dismantle the relay and pry apart the contacts. This must work till you purchase a replacement-- which you should do soon.<p>
