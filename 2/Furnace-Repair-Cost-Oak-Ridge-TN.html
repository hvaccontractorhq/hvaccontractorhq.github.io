<p>In some cases, however, constructing residents experience symptoms that do not fit the pattern of any specific illness and are hard to trace to any specific phenomenon has actually been labeled sick structure syndrome. People might suffer one or more of the following signs: dry or burning mucous membranes in the nose, eyes, and throat; sneezing; stuffy or runny nose; tiredness or sleepiness; headache; dizziness; nausea; irritation and lapse of memory. Poor lighting, sound, vibration, thermal discomfort, and mental stress might also cause, or contribute to, these symptoms.<p>
<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires running HVAC systems as developed. Wetness management and humidity control might contravene efforts to try to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For example, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply cosmetics air at lower temperature levels (design levels), instead of the greater temperature levels often used to save energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. However, for the majority of the US and numerous parts of Europe and Japan, during most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require additional cooling to supply thermal comfort indoors. However, high humidity outdoors produces the need for cautious attention to humidity levels inside. High humidities give rise to mold growth and wetness inside is related to a greater occurrence of occupant respiratory problems.<p>

The only genuine exception to this would be a geothermal heatpump system. However, a geothermal installation normally costs tens of thousands more than an air source heatpump, which normally indicates it stops working in regards to return on investment.<p>
