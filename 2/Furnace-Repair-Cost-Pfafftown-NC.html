The reasonable heat of the incoming air, as determined by a dry bulb thermometer, is reduced. The temperature of the incoming air is reduced, but it is also more humid, so the total heat (practical heat plus latent heat) is unchanged. Some of the practical heat of the getting in air is transformed to latent heat by the evaporation of water in the wet cooler pads. If the going into air is dry enough, the outcomes can be quite significant.<p>

<p>It prevails to presume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, fairly stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and occupants), and what is around it (the larger environment).

In fact, the real nature of buildings can be deemed the outcome of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be explained and comprehended as complicated systems. Research study using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of communities can assist increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those methods to the developed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
