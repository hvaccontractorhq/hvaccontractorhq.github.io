<p>Air-conditioning systems are constantly working to give your home that perfect temperature all year round. But while they're cycling through all that air, they're filtering out some of those typical air toxins. Ultimately, their air filters fill up and stop doing their job. Not only does that cause trouble for your indoor air quality, it also uses down your AC system, which can cause pricey repairs down the road. So, be sure to alter your AC filters frequently, or get an air conditioning service strategy which typically includes a filter change - especially if you are allergy-prone or reside in a city with high levels of pollution.<p>
<p>If you have an older central air conditioner, you may choose to replace the outside compressor with a modern, high-efficiency unit. If you do so, speak with a local heating and cooling contractor to guarantee that the brand-new compressor is correctly matched to the indoor system. However, thinking about current changes in refrigerants and cooling designs, it might be wiser to change the whole system.<p>
