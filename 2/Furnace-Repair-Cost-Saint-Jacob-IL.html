<p>Particle matter (PM)-- Discovered both within and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of solid particles and liquid beads suspended in the air, such as dust, pollen, soot, and smoke. The particles themselves are different sizes, but the ones to be most concerned about are the smallest-- 10 micrometers in size or smaller sized-- due to the fact that they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can impact the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, generated by construction, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, participates in structures via mechanical and natural ventilation. Indoors it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans utilize air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent usage candle lights or incense that often, our nationally representative survey discovered. Approximately 40 percent hardly ever or never ever clean their humidifier or kitchen range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have actually never cleaned up or changed their furnace filter. And nearly 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can worsen indoor air quality.<p>
