<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you ought to keep an eye out for. First, you need to inspect your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little ridiculous, however ice on your a/c can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat properly if completely iced over.<p>
