<p>All heating unit have some level of air filtering. From one of the most standard, 1-inch filter in the blower cabinet, to the larger, 4-inch media filter typically in its own cabinet outside the furnace, to the more advanced electronic air cleaners and air purifiers, all need some standard maintenance.

<p>To put this just, Preventative maintenance is NECESSARY TO protect the effectiveness and performance of your HVAC system, several studies through DOE and ACCA can verify this if you're interested. However, select your contractor carefully, a number of the 'credible' contractors promoted by Angie's list are not immune to inappropriate sales techniques that DO benefit from uninformed property owners.

While Angie's list is an excellent base line indicator that you MIGHT be working with a trusted company, you still should do your homework (not all contractors with a comparable ranking are the very same). There is a wealth of customer education through both the ACCA (A/c contractors of America) and (This is an arm of the Department of Energy).<p>
<p>Start by reading the installation handbook and familiarizing yourself with all the included hardware and fasteners. Many systems come with a kit that includes adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will make sure an airtight and protected fit in the window opening. And for additional assistance, especially for bigger air conditioning unit, consider acquiring a steel support bracket and install it to the outdoors home wall, directly listed below the windowsill.<p>
