<p>It may feel relaxing being sealed in tight versus the cold in your house throughout the chillier months of the year, however for people who are sensitive to indoor irritants or have respiratory issues, winter season can exacerbate problems.

<p>Second, recognition of impurity sources is frequently essential to identifying the cause( s) of worker health symptoms. Such information can sometimes be gotten by asking for copies of air monitoring information from the company. If monitoring information is not readily available, yet a high variety of health symptoms have actually been reported, the Union representative need to request that the company have air tracking tests carried out. Evaluation of this data might identify possibly dangerous sources of contamination and resultant worker health symptoms. However, when pollutant concentrations are really low, keeping an eye on data might not describe the observed or reported health signs.<p>
