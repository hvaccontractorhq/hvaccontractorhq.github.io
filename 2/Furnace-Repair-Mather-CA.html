<p>Professional heating unit setups. Nevertheless, even the best-maintained heater will ultimately stop working. HVAC professionals recommend following this basic guideline when deciding whether it deserves buying a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth changing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than required.<p>
<p>Geothermal heatpump, in addition to all other kinds of heat pumps, have performances rated according to their coefficient of efficiency, or COP. It's a clinical way of figuring out how much energy the system moves versus just how much it uses. A lot of geothermal heatpump systems have COPs of 3.0 to 5.0. This means for every single system of energy used to power the system, three to 5 systems are supplied as heat.<p>
