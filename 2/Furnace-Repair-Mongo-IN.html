<p>Current Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
