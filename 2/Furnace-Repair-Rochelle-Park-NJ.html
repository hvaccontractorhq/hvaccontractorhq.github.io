<h3>HVAC Service Technician in Rochelle Park NJ</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the choice to reverse the refrigeration cycle and act as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly referred to as "reverse cycle ac system". The heat pump is substantially more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated area, along with the heat from purchased electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches functions and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser unit likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
