<p>Moisture management and humidity control requires operating HVAC systems as developed. Moisture management and humidity control might conflict with efforts to attempt to enhance the operation to conserve energy. For instance, wetness management and humidity control needs systems to be set to supply makeup air at lower temperatures (style levels), instead of the greater temperatures in some cases used to conserve energy in cooling-dominated climate conditions. Nevertheless, for the majority of the US and lots of parts of Europe and Japan, throughout most of hours of the year, outside air temperature levels are cool enough that the air does not require further cooling to provide thermal comfort inside your home.

<p>Oil furnaces tend to be greater in maintenance than other types. They produce a great deal of soot, which requires to be appropriately vented and cleaned up from the furnace frequently.

<p>Ducts running in closets take up less space than you might believe. Since the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably small 2x4-foot closet, they take up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors might suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile hose pipe) rather of rigid square ducts. But avoid flex duct in active closet spaces-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
