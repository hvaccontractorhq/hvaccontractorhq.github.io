<p>In homes, the most substantial sources of formaldehyde are most likely to be pushed wood products used adhesives that contain urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. Pushed wood items produced indoor use consist of: particleboard (utilized as subflooring and shelving and in cabinets and furnishings); hardwood plywood paneling (utilized for ornamental wall covering and utilized in cabinets and furnishings); and medium density fiber board (used for drawer fronts, cabinets, and furnishings tops).

<p>G&S did an outstanding job installing our new furnace and AC unit. The very best aspect of G&S is that they warranty for 1 year.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, returns to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. In the process, heat is soaked up from inside and moved outdoors, leading to cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Carbon monoxide gas (CO) is an odorless, colorless harmful gas. Because it is difficult to see, smell or taste, CO can kill you before you are aware it remains in your home. At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild results that are often incorrect for the influenza. These signs include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, fatigue and nausea. The results of CO exposure can differ greatly from individual to individual depending upon age, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure.<p>
