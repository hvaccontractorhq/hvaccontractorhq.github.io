We understand about air pollution and acid rain, we can see smoke and odor exhaust, and we may even hold our breaths when we see that semi truck gush thick clouds of black smoke ahead of us in traffic. According to the EPA, however, the levels of indoor air toxins are typically 2 to 5 times greater than outdoor levels, and in some cases these levels can exceed 100 times that of outside levels of the exact same contaminants. In other words, sometimes the air inside can be more harmful than the air outside.<p>
<p>Radiant heating provides a number of special advantages over forced air heating unit. For instance, radiant heating systems are more energy efficient than forced air systems. They don't need to stress over duct leaks, which are responsible for output losses of approximately 30% in other heating unit types. Sending heat through strong things will also cause it to last longer than using air as a thermal medium. A home heated up by a radiant system will heat up quicker, and stay warm with less energy invested. These are just a few of the numerous advantages that a radiant heat system can provide you.<p>
