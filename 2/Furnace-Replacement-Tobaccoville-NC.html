<p>Poor indoor air quality is usually brought on by the absence of adequate ventilation, which leads to an accumulation of contaminants from sources in the house. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined insufficient ventilation as the primary issue in more than half the workplace indoor air examinations it has conducted. Investigations performed in houses by the Illinois Department of Public Health have discovered the same to be true. These investigations revealed that proper ventilation is necessary in preserving excellent indoor air quality.<p>

Sources of VOC contamination from outside could consist of unpredictable chemicals in polluted groundwater that are pulled within during water use.<p>
