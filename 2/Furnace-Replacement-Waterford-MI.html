<p>Mark (owner) and group were fantastic from start to finish. I 'd priced out new units and installation for months. Once I chose to final move on in March 2015 on the Lennox line (aka. "the Cadillac of AC's) Mark ended up hooking me up with a 3 Load system and hands down beat every other bidder by serveral thousand dollars when whatever was stated and done. Not just was the cost fantastic but Mark went out of his method to personalize a few things in my house to make the total air circulation more optimized. I believe it literally only took them 6 hours total time (start to finish) to get my system installed. I have no doubt any future business related to my AC will go Air Pros way.<p>
