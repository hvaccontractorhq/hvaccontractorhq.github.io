<p>When installing a wall sensor, think about the height at which they need to be put. Many frequently they are installed at height-level or somewhat lower, if individuals primarily stay seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate toward the floor or ceiling; depending upon what pollutant you're attempting to track you'll need to put the sensor appropriately. For instance, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the greatest concentrations inside structures are generally near the ceiling. On the other hand, ozone is much heavier than air and stays near the flooring.<p>
