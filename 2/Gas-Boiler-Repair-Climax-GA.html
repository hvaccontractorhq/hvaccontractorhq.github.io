<p>The majority of central air conditioners are linked to a home's forced-air circulation system. Thus, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to disperse cool air from the air conditioning system. When a central air conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house flows to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioning unit works however your house doesn't cool, the problem is most likely in the distribution system.<p>
