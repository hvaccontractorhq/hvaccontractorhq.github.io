Generally this leaves about 6% of profits to the owner. For a company that brings in $1 million, the owner would get $60,000 in take home pay. This does not seem like much, specifically if the objective of owning a company was for monetary flexibility. Plus, this 6% is after the couple of years it required to construct business and not taking an earnings as the owner. However, this 6% typically isn't completion objective.
