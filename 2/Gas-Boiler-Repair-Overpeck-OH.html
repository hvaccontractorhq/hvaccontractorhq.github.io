<h3>The Most Frequent Reasons For Blocked Ducts in HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>A lot of residential heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) systems recirculate indoor air to save energy. The current pattern in home building and construction is to lower air leak through fractures and other openings in walls, floors, and roofings. The mix of these construction practices and the recirculation of indoor air has resulted in an increase in indoor air issues. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) suggests that a minimum of 15 cubic feet of outdoor make-up air per minute (CFM) per individual be brought into the indoor living areas of residential buildings. The ASHRAE guidelines for make-up air for bathroom and kitchens in homes are much greater. This fresh make-up air helps and dilutes indoor impurities tire them from the home.<p>
<p>The condensate drain in your a/c and heat pump should be devoid of all blockages and particles.

An expert maintenance technician will flush and clean up the condensate drain to make sure all excess wetness streams far from the system.<p>

The heat exchanger enables air to be heated without coming in contact with the actual flame or burner area.
