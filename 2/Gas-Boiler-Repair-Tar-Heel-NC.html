<h3>Choosing the Proper Company For Heating and AC Systems in Tar Heel NC</h3>
<p>Sean was very handy. He is a really enjoyable person to work with. No pressure used to buy extra stuff. Answered all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the unit. that was to make certain they were no concerns other than the blower motor. Since there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the brand-new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and install that, now that he knows for sure what the issue is.<p>
<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both wonderful. Just this morning I discovered I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the same day. He understood just what the issue was and repaired it extremely rapidly. But here is the very best ONE. About ten years ago my entire cooling and gas heat went totally dead. I thought for sure it was a $20,000 job. Ilan was able to find out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for a lot more.<p>
