<p>Ducts running in closets take up less area than you might believe. Because the majority of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a reasonably little 2x4-foot closet, they take up simply 4 of the 64 offered cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may recommend utilizing "flex duct" (a small, economical versatile tube) instead of rigid square ducts. But prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand up well to use and tear and is quickly punctured.<p>
