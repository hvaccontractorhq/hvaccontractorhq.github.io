<p>It's not right away clear why Target would have provided an HVAC company external network gain access to, or why that access would not be cordoned off from Target's payment system network. However according to a cybersecurity professional at a big retailer who asked not to be named because he did not have consent to speak on the record, it is common for large retail operations to have a group that regularly monitors energy usage and temperatures in shops to minimize costs (especially at night) and to alert shop supervisors if temperature levels in the stores fluctuate outside of an acceptable range that might avoid consumers from shopping at the shop.<p>

The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
