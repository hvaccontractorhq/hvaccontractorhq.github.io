<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly if entirely iced over.<p>
