<p>It is common to assume that buildings are just inanimate physical entities, reasonably stable over time. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably the same physical material over time. In fact, the real nature of structures can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the methods ecologists utilize to the understanding of ecosystems can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the built environment thinking about the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
