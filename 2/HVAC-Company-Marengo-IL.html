<p>The main issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees attempt to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system creates more difficulties, because a few of indoor units can be located far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the a/c separately for each space. However, now the marketplace has a broad selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>

<p>Legionella is a parasite of protozoans such as amoeba, and thus needs conditions appropriate for both organisms. The germs forms a biofilm which is resistant to chemical and antimicrobial treatments, consisting of chlorine. Removal for Legionella break outs in commercial buildings differ, but frequently consist of really warm water flushes (160 ° F; 70 ° C), sterilisation of standing water in evaporative cooling basins, replacement of shower heads, and in many cases flushes of heavy metal salts. Preventive procedures consist of adjusting typical warm water levels to permit 120 ° F( 50 ° C )at the tap, evaluating facility design layout, eliminating faucet aerators, and periodic screening in suspect areas.<p>
