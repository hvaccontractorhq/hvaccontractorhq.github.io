<p>Recent Review: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My air conditioner broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was fantastic. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and gotten here on time. He took the time to explain whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was polite and well-informed. I was charged a reasonable price. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
