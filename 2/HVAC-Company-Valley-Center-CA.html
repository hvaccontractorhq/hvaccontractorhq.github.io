<p>We are OPEN as an "Vital Service" during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It sounds amazing, but furnace service technicians frequently find that the only "repair" a furnace requires is to be turned on. Try to find a standard wall switch on or near the furnace-- all heating systems, no matter what age or type, have one somewhere. Check the circuit breaker or fuse for the furnace also. Make certain the front panel covering the blower motor is firmly secured-- there's a push-in switch under it that should be completely depressed for the furnace to run.<p>

All-electric boilers can attain up to 95 to one hundred percent AFUE, according to the DOE. Newer gas boilers must achieve 80 percent AFUE and more recent fossil-fueled boilers must attain a 75 percent AFUE.<p>
