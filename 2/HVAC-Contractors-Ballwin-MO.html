<h3>An Overview of Central Heating Systems at Ballwin MO</h3>
<p>Numerous Canadian jurisdictions do not have specific legislation that handles indoor air quality problems. In the lack of such legislation, the "general duty stipulation" applies.

<p>The primary health impact related to exposure to raised levels of radon is lung cancer. Research recommends that swallowing water with high radon levels might present threats, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air consisting of radon. Significant health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Avoidance, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless preventable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon triggers about 14,000 deaths each year in the United States-however, this number could vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths each year. If you smoke and your house has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
