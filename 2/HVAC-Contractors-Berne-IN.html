Either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages if your air conditioner is low on refrigerant. If it leaks, simply including refrigerant is not a solution. An experienced technician must fix any leakage, test the repair, and then charge the system with the correct amount of refrigerant. Keep in mind that the efficiency and performance of your air conditioner is biggest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the producer's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged. Refrigerant leakages can also be damaging to the environment.<p>
<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of various system types. Most common are boilers, which are called hydronic radiant heating systems, and electric systems, which are frequently referred to as merely glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have heating aspects installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, occasionally connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system is in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating components throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating components, through the flooring, and into the room. This is why the method is referred to as radiant heating.<p>
