<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the 2 service technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and hung out working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
