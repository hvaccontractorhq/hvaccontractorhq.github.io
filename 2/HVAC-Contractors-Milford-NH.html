<p>Now, there are a few common signs of a need for air conditioning unit repair, which you should look out for. Initially, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is actually responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can inadvertently lower the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
