<p>There are some varieties of mold which contain harmful compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin via inhalation is not possible in many cases, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at substantial levels in the released spores. The primary threat of mold development, as it associates with indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic residential or commercial properties of the spore cell wall.

The hot air is moved by the blower throughout the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then delivered through ducts to cool the house. When the air conditioner works however your home does not cool, the issue is probably in the circulation system.<p>
