You may look for a heat pump more tailored toward cooling capability and efficiency if you currently have a home heating system.

The good news is that the one major downside of heatpump is that they can stop working in the cold or incredibly hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>

Discover how central air conditioners compare to other cooling systems.<p>
