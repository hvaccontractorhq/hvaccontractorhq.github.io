The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of carbon dioxide to quasi "constant state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based.

<p>It is common to assume that structures are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively stable gradually. This implies that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We commonly see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a structure as reasonably unchanged physical product in time. In reality, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the outcome of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be explained and comprehended as intricate systems. Research applying the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can assist increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of structures, their occupants, and the larger environment.<p>
