<h3>The Way to Keep Healthy Ductwork for A Healthy Home in Stanford KY</h3>
<p>All modern-day a/c systems, even little window bundle units, are equipped with internal air filters. These are typically of a lightweight gauze-like material, and need to be replaced or washed as conditions warrant. For example, a building in a high dust environment, or a house with furry pets, will need to have the filters altered more often than buildings without these dirt loads. Failure to change these filters as required will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened equipment life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can completely stop air flow. In addition, very unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can result in damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>The primary step to fixing any issue is detecting what the problem is in the top place. If we find your system needs a significant repair, we waive our diagnostic charges. The parts we utilize are backed up with a two-year parts service warranty when we do any repair. Our diagnostics service and waived charge provide you with a 2nd alternative that comes with the guarantee benefit if you have actually spoken to another company and got a quote.<p>

<p>I usually do not leave evaluations however wanted to share my experience. You don't prepare for needing to replace your AC unit. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they responded to. That goes a long way. Other companies would set up a call and not call back. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss alternatives. I arranged my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a household buddy and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Excellent service within 24 hr and a reasonable cost. The technician (Camryn) was really extensive and on-time in discussing what services would be carried out.

He made a few ideas of some maintenance jobs we might want to have actually performed in the future, however without the high pressure up-sale tactics used by some in the industry.<p>
