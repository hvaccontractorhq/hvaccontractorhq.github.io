<h3>Heat Ventilation in West Linn OR</h3>
<p>I usually do not leave evaluations but wanted to share my experience. You do not expect having to replace your AC system. Sadly for us, we had no other alternative. What made me opt for this company was their communication top to bottom. When I called they answered. That goes a long way. Other companies would arrange a call and not recall. My experience began with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional discussing my options. After business hours Erik still addressed my calls to work out and talk about alternatives. I scheduled my install and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and answered my questions as they were working. I never felt that I remained in the their way. We were referred by a family friend and now I will advise this company to my good friends.<p>
<p>When the heat pump headed out in our workplaces, Taylor at Stability was extremely helpful in gathering details on the phone and providing clear guidelines about how to momentarily deal with the issue and prepare the heat pump for efficient repair the next day. Levi was out the very first thing next morning (at 8:00 AM). He was incredibly effective and offered clear communication about the problem, its remedies, and its future prevention. The repair fasted and cost less than I 'd anticipated, and the service was expert and friendly. And, the work space was left cleaner than when Levi began. I will absolutely use Integrity Energy Systems once again, for office and home.<p>
