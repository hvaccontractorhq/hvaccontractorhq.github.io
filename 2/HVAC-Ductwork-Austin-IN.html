Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company reacted immediately, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to coordinate their deal with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the unit sits. I feel like they give me favoritism, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that assurance.<p>
