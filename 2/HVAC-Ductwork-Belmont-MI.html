<p>Current Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, well-informed, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>Weatherization usually does not cause indoor air issues by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a few exceptions, such as caulking, that can sometimes discharge pollutants.) However, steps such as setting up storm windows, weather condition removing, caulking, and blown-in wall insulation can decrease the quantity of outdoor air penetrating into a house. As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air pollutants from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
<p>Often a short-term indoor air quality issue is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or structure, such as an overcrowded meeting location. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. However more complicated issues-- recognized by consistently undesirable air quality monitoring results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the concern you're experiencing, one of the three tactics listed below might be suitable.<p>
