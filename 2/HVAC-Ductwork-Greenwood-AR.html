<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical blend used in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most designs altered to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting capacity of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer manufactured in the U.S. for this kind of application, however is still imported and can be purchased and used by certified HVAC professionals. For systems needing just a periodic "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in good working order and carrying out far better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "converted" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is thought about "cheap" by many individuals.<p>
