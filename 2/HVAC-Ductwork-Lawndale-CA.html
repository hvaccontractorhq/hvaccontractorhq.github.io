<p>The main issue when setting up a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for connecting the external system to the internal ones. While installing a separate split system, employees try to locate both units opposite to each other, where the length of the line is very little. Installing a multi-split system produces more problems, given that some of indoor units can be situated far from the exterior. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one typical control system that did not enable you to set the cooling separately for each space. Nevertheless, now the marketplace has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the practical qualities of indoor systems run independently from each other.<p>
