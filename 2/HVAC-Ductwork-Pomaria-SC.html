(If the thermostat you purchase is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can cause overloads and annoyance circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we elected to set up a devoted circuit with its own wiring and breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are offered.<p>
