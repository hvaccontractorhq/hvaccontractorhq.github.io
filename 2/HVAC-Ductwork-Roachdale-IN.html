<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor units has one limitation: their overall power needs to not exceed the capability of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is extremely typical to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor units higher than the outside capacity by at least 20%. However, it is incorrect to anticipate better efficiency when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capacity of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outdoor unit will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a method that some of the spaces might not have a really comfortable temperature level. However, the computation of the total power is not easy, given that it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, but also the cooling capacity, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>
<p>Rather of incorporating to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head system that mounts on a wall. A ductless unit has an integrated efficiency advantage due to the fact that up to 20% of the heat energy produced by a central HVAC unit may be lost to leaks in your ducts. Ductless heat pumps are fantastic for additions since they don't require any new ductwork to be installed. Since a system is installed in each room or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensors that instantly raise the temperature level in the space when you are present.<p>
