<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They give me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Purchased a new primary unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
