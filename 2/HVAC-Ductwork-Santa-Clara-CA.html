I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in exact same day, the day prior to Thanksgiving. Ends up the igniter they installed the week prior was defective. No charge for the see or the brand-new part. I was very delighted they waited their work and fixed the problem. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>
