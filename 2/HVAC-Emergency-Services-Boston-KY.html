<p>Right now, millions of dust mites, dead skin cells, building and construction particles, and mold might be living in your home's duct, impacting the air you breathe along with the performance of your heating and air conditioning system. There are a number of design methods in use today; however, all ground source heatpump operate with comparable concepts. Each one pumps liquid through the geothermal loop between the surface area units and the underground heat source, whether that be an aquifer or the internal heat within the earth at depth. These different heat sources likewise determine the nature of the system itself, with an aquifer using an open loop, and systems based upon the earth's heat using a closed loop.<p>
