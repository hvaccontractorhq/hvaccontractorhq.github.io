<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently receives ask for consultation and help in addressing indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the general public, other department personnel, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, lots of house owners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy preservation step. Nevertheless, a lot of these houses were found to have relatively high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde soon after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies reveal that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was set up several years earlier are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

<h3>Turning to the Ideal Company for the Right Furnace Repair at Castleton VA</h3>
<p>Specific immediate effects resemble those from colds or other viral illness, so it is typically difficult to identify if the symptoms are an outcome of direct exposure to indoor air contamination. For this factor, it is necessary to take note of the time and place symptoms happen. If the symptoms fade or disappear when a person is away from the location, for instance, an effort should be made to determine indoor air sources that might be possible causes. Some results might be made worse by an inadequate supply of outdoor air coming inside or from the heating, cooling or humidity conditions common inside.<p>
<p>Current Review: I am very happy with Bob's Heating and Cooling. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and replaced the part and everything works great now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He gave me a courtesy call before coming out and arrived on time. He made the effort to discuss whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the a/c unit and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a reasonable cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they offer.<p>
