<h3>The Most Frequent Causes of Blocked Ducts at HVAC Systems</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system using refrigerant piping between an indoor and outside  unit instead of ducting air straight from the outside system. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor systems install inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct deal with air from the indoor system to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>When mounting a wall sensing unit, think about the height at which they ought to be placed. A lot of commonly they are installed at height-level or slightly lower, if people primarily stay seated in that particular location. However, the molecular weight of some substances makes them gravitate towards the floor or ceiling; depending upon what contaminant you're attempting to track you'll need to position the sensing unit accordingly. For example, as you can see on the chart below, methane is lighter than air and so the highest concentrations inside structures are normally near the ceiling. Conversely, ozone is heavier than air and remains near the floor.<p>
