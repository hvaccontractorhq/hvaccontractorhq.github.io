<p>Recent Review: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two specialists I have actually had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the system, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
<p>My eldest son always grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him but then I recognized that it actually didnâ $ t distribute air like it did in the past. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except changing it. The one I got deserves every penny. The sound level is low and itâ $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
