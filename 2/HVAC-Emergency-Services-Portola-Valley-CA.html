<p>Have used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 units two times a year. They provide me concern and a lower rate when I have concerns. Bought a brand-new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever buy extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Excellent financial investment in my viewpoint. Never attempt to offer me something I don't require.<p>
