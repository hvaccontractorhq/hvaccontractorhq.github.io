<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature is frequently in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), because heatpump end up being ineffective in more severe cold.

To compensate for this, the heatpump system should momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to change the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and defrost. Some heatpump systems will therefore have a form of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is activated only in this mode in order to compensate for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
