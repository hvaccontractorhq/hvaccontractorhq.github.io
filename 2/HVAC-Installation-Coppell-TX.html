<h3>Commercial Air Conditioner in Coppell Texas</h3>
<p>There are some varieties of mold that contain hazardous compounds (mycotoxins). However, direct exposure to harmful levels of mycotoxin through inhalation is not possible most of the times, as toxic substances are produced by the fungal body and are not at considerable levels in the launched spores. The main threat of mold development, as it relates to indoor air quality, comes from the allergenic homes of the spore cell wall.
