<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air modifications (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate moisture, Air cleaning happens. The objective is to offer sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are several kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to achieve this. A common aspect necessary in all systems is duct sealing, particularly on the return side (side drawing in the air). The A/c Contractors Association (ACCA) provides guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Style.<p>
