<p>Expert heating system installations. However, even the best-maintained heating system will eventually fail. HVAC experts advise following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost more than half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to buy brand-new. At the 15-year mark, it might be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system will not have many more years left in it, and it's most likely to be utilizing more energy than necessary.<p>

<p>In the UK, the Ozone Laws 85 entered force in 2000 and prohibited using ozone depleting HCFC refrigerants such as R22 in new systems. The Guideline prohibited the use of R22 as a "top-up" fluid for maintenance between 2010 (for virgin fluid) and 2015 (for recycled fluid).
