<p>Current Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the problem. Bob's provided a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician explained the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement tries to upsell you every time they pertain to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be revealing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, giving her a 10% discount if she restored her PMA for 7 years, although it was six months before the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtering system, but they talked her into it.<p>
