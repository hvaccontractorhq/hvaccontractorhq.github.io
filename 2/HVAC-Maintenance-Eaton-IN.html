<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature (which is a standard mode of operation for modern a/c unit) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the a/c increase. This increase has the impact that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning system should increase its power intake by the inverse of its "effectiveness" (coefficient of performance) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is activated, and the a/c unit has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning system's power consumption will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, therefore making the 100 W heating component cost a total of 150 W of power.<p>
