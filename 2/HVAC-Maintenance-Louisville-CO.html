<h3>Water Heater and HVAC System Maintenance at Louisville CO</h3>
<p>The remainder of the HVAC system likewise needs to be in top condition for the air conditioning unit to work well. This consists of the air handler, evaporator coil, ductwork and registers, all of which live inside the house.

Sealing leakages in ductwork can enhance HVAC performance by as much as 30 percent, and attend to a cooler house in the hot summer.<p>
<p>If you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air, check these 3 things first. Ensure all the registers in the house are large open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). The reduced air flow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home if several registers were closed or the filter was clogged.

Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or till there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You've solved the problem if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
