Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no problems besides the blower motor. Because there was not one on hand, the only reason he could not set up the new blower motor was. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he knows for sure what the problem is.<p>
