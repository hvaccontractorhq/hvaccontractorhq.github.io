<p>Many individuals ignore the degree of the indoor air contamination problem. Air pollution is normally envisioned as the black smoke produced from factories. Little thought is provided to tobacco smoke and the by-products of aerosol sprays, cleaners, pesticides, and paints utilized in the house.

<p>Changing a capacitor is simple. Simply take a photo of the wires before detaching anything (you might need a recommendation in the future). Then release the stored energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each connector to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the adapter and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the brand-new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
