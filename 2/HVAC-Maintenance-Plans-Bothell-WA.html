<p>Ducted heatpump heating and cooling systems act similar to traditional central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living spaces through a duct system. A ducted heat pump system may be most cost effective if your house or building has an existing duct system that remains in good condition. Utilizing existing ductwork will get rid of the need to set up an expensive brand-new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
