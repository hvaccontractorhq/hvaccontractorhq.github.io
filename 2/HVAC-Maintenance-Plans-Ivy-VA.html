<p>Recent Evaluation: I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous company because the 2 specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, well-informed, neat, and hung out exercising the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was easy. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
