<p>Have actually used the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. When I have concerns, they offer me top priority and a lower rate. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Good investment in my viewpoint. Never ever attempt to sell me something I don't require.<p>
