<h3>Typical HVAC Services Offered with a Landing NJ HVAC Company</h3>
<p>One of the primary factors a furnace will run continuously is because something is unclean or clogged Prior to trying to fix any problem, take some time to make certain that the thermostat settings are not at continuous fan".

<p>Examine these 3 things first if you believe that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Make sure all the signs up in the house are broad open. Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Image 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the decreased airflow might have triggered the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. Deice the A-coil if you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting airflow at the registers. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Car" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or up until there's good air flow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to evaluate it. If it works for the next 12 hours, you've solved the problem.<p>
