Then make sure the furnace filter is tidy Then go outdoors and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The decreased airflow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if numerous signs up were closed or the filter was obstructed. Deice the A-coil if you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the registers.
