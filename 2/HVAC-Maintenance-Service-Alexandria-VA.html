<p>Central air units are measured in loads. This measurement is based on the system's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 lot unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot unit will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't acquainted with the term BTU, it indicates the quantity of energy needed to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F Â°.<p>
<p>Moreover, radiators heat the air nearest them first, which is why spaces heated by radiators are susceptible to cold areas", indicating that the air feels cold in the middle of the room and really hot beside the radiators. This generally results in opening a window above the radiator to bring some fresh air in, and there we go once again, letting all that energy paid to warm up your house escape out of the window. Radiant heat supplies heat from the flooring up throughout the space with no cold spots or stuffiness in the area being heated.<p>
