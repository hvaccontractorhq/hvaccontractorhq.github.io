<h3>Heat Ventilation in Campbell CA</h3>
<p>Wow - just wow. I never have actually heard of the $5000 guideline but got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 heaters - one inside and never requires maintenance and one outdoors and needs yearly or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to purchase stainless steel tubing and quality stainless-steel sheet metal and have a metal shop craft one up rather than buy something that is simply going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply insane and all over the place and I think they understand they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
