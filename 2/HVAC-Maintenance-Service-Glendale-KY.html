<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Cooling company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound because 1978. The choice of indoor units has one limitation: their total power should not exceed the capability of the outside system. In practice, however, it is very typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capability of indoor units greater than the outside capability by at least 20%.

Due to the fact that an unit is installed in each room or area you want to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature level of each zone, which can save energy. Some mini-splits even have tenancy sensors that automatically raise the temperature level in the room when you are present.<p>
