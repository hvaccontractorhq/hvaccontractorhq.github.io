<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you need to watch out for. First, you must check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, however ice on your a/c can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
