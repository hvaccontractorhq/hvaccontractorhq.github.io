<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning aid determine the effectiveness of dilution. Air modifications arise from a mix of natural ventilation (infiltration; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation.

There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to achieve this.
