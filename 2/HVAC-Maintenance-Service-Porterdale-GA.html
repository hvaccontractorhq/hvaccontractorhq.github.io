<p>Oil heaters are generally not extremely efficient. They utilize less fuel than other furnace types, but many do not attain an effectiveness higher than 90%. A couple of high-end brands have a performance of 95% by utilizing a condenser. These are more expensive, having starting costs for the furnace itself at around $5,000. You pay more for the installation too since a drain needs to be set up.<p>
<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your cars and truck's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation.

When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator requires managed by specialists, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
