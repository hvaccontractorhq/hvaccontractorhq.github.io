<p>Ducted heatpump cooling and heating systems act similar to standard central heating and cooling systems. The heatpump system sits outdoors, and the indoor fan coil works to move conditioned air into living areas through a duct system. A ducted heatpump system may be most cost effective if your house or structure has an existing duct system that remains in good shape. Using existing ductwork will remove the requirement to install an expensive new duct system, which can cost thousands.<p>
<p>Inquire about training and certifications. A good place to start is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) certification. It's kind of a minimum requirement for picking an HVAC company, but a lot of contractors out there haven't bothered with it! Kick it up a notch by trying to find Structure Performance Institute (BPI) certification. Managers with BPI accreditation know that the house is a system and see HVAC devices as just one element (out of lots of) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>Circuit Board Replacement: â $ " Â Many heaters have several control boards. The largest, or only one in some heating systems, is often called the Motherboard. The circuit boards control and coordinate the operation of the motors, sensors, ignitor, gas valve and more. DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel must be installed precisely right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t effectively detected, changing a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable as soon as set up. Itâ $ s wise to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
