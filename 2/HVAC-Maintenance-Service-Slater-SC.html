<p>Air conditioning can likewise be supplied by a process called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn serves as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later employing a heatpump to chill the circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
<p>Indoor temperatures are in some cases more challenging to manage than they appear due to elements such as heat gains from sunlight, outside conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate. ASHRAE suggests temperature levels varying from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be preserved at or listed below 65%. The EPA recommends humidity levels of in between 30% and 60% to reduce mold development.<p>

Many units feature a kit that includes adjustable window extensions and metal mounting brackets. These parts will guarantee an airtight and secure fit in the window opening.
