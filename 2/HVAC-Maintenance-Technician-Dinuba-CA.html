<p>Asthmatic children are specifically at threat. EPA estimates that exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and intensity of symptoms in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and may trigger thousands of nonasth-matic kids to develop the disease each year. EPA estimates that between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to pre-owned smoke triggers nose, eye, and throat inflammation. It might impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have connected direct exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain.

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your car's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by circulating an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator stops working, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from occurring, have your radiator serviced frequently. To have your radiator needs handled by professionals, check out Eric's Garage today.<p>
