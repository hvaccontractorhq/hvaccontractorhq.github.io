Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also must be correctly preserved to prevent bacteria and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Keep an eye out for signs of water leaks or flooding to stop mold from growing. Porous materials, wall, flooring, and ceiling coverings, and furnishings found in the basements that have actually been wet for over 24 to two days may end up being a source for mold growth and must be discarded. Sometimes there is a musty smell however mold can not be seen.

Fix the moisture issue, either by finding the leakage or water source or by dehumidifying the location. Thoroughly clean the location using recognized health department recommendations.<p>
