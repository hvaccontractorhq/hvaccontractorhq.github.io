<p>If you presume a mold problem-- either because of visible development or a moldy smell regularly coming from supply vents-- cleaning ducts will not do much great if it doesn't eliminate the mold. Mold starts with a wetness issue, and the ducts themselves are unlikely to be the source. The most likely offenders are the cooling system's evaporator coils, which your heating and air-conditioning contractor-- and most duct-cleaning companies-- can examine and keep. Leaky return ducts can likewise present wetness. Again, if you believe a mold issue, think about having a service company inspect the duct system for leaks.<p>
<p>To be honest, few of the facilities managers who utilize our indoor air quality tracking service pertained to us because of that. Generally they were at first interested in remotely keeping an eye on some other aspect of their structures, such as energy usage, in an effort to cut expenses. It wasn't until later, as they continued working with us, that they discovered and implemented indoor air quality keeping an eye on to offer a healthier, much safer building environment-- and to head off the negative consequences related to indoor air contaminants.<p>
<p>Regularly, nevertheless, private investigators will need to come to the structure to carry out individual interviews with residents, to try to find possible sources of the problems, and to check the design and operation of the ventilation system and other building features. Because taking measurements of toxins at the very low levels often discovered in office complex is expensive and might not yield details readily beneficial in recognizing problem sources, investigators may not take lots of measurements. The process of fixing indoor air quality problems that lead to health and convenience problems can be a slow one, involving several trial solutions before successful restorative actions are determined.<p>
