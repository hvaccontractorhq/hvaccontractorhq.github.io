<p>The homes and composition of the soil in an area can affect the rate at which heat is performed through the ground. These should be taken into consideration before picking the very best style of an underground heating & cooling system. Soil with favorable heat transfer properties requires fewer pipes to accomplish the wanted underground heating and cooling effect, while those with reduced thermal conductivity will need more pipes.<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be supplied by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is removed from the cooled space. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed by means of a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capacity are hybrid systems, using complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature of the storage gradually increases throughout the cooling season, therefore decreasing its effectiveness.<p>
