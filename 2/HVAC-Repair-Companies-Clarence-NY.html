<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He committed to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and provided with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, set up on Wednesday). Protexs deal was one of the couple of affordable ones received. Others were almost two times the quantity Protex quoted for low end off brand name equipment. I got Carrier. ProTex effectively advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser although it would have made them more money (Honesty) The install group was respectful of my home and set up the equipment in the anticipated quantity of time. post set up assessment results look great for braising and plumbing quality. New unit cools better than the 13 year old 4 lot R22 unit it changed (also Carrier).<p>
