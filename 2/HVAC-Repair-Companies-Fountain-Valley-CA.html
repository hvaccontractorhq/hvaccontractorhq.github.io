<h3>Heat Pumps: What Are They And How Do They Work in Fountain Valley CA?</h3>
<p>After residing in our home for 15 years we figured itâ $ s time to change the air conditioning. I proceeded and bought this Carrier and I need to state it does the job rather well. It takes very little time to warm up or cool off your home which is among the things we didnâ $ t receive from the one we had previously. The unit hasnâ $ t required any repair work and Iâ $ ve had it for about half a year now.<p>
<p>Recent Review: I am very delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My ac system broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call prior to coming out and arrived on time. He put in the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was knowledgeable and respectful. I was charged a fair cost. I will call Bob's from now on for any work related to the services they provide.<p>
