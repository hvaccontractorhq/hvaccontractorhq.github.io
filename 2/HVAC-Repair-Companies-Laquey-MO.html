<p>SysTech Design focuses on industrial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control technique for improving and keeping the quality of the air around an industrial environment. The same is true for the evaporator coils inside your home's cooling system. Evaporator coils trigger condensation, dehumidifying the air before it circulates through your house. Condensed wetness can trigger dust and other particles to stay with and build up on the coils. Also, cleaning the collector pan (and the drain spout in the pan) below the coils guarantees dirt does not develop and get drawn into the system. It also avoids water from collecting on and beneath the coils, which can trigger mold problems.<p>
