Oftentimes, these units include not only the air conditioning system itself but likewise a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged units are great for those looking to conserve cash on the installation of a new cooling and heating system independently, since the system is integrated. Nevertheless, one con is that these units are usually only offered for bigger houses due to their high power and capability. In addition, while they can be a great way to conserve money on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more pricey than purchasing simply a cooling system.
