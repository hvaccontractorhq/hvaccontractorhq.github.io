<p>The instructions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn great we felt comfortable completing the electrical wiring of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new circuit breaker and last connections in the primary circuit panel to a local electrician. We recommend you do the exact same. When the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make sure the controls work and resistance cable heats up. Don't put the system into full operation till the thin-set and grout have actually had time to effectively harden and treat-- normally two to 4 weeks. Then call the household together and play a video game of Scrabble on your comfortable, warm restroom flooring.<p>
