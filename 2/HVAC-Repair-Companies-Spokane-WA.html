<p>It is common to assume that buildings are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the building, what is in it (contents and residents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We frequently see the overwhelming majority of the mass of product in a building as reasonably unchanged physical material over time. In reality, the real nature of buildings can be considered as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions amongst their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Structures can be described and understood as complicated systems. Research using the techniques ecologists utilize to the understanding of environments can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment thinking about the vibrant system of structures, their residents, and the larger environment.<p>
