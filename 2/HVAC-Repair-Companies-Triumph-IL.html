<p>It prevails to presume that structures are simply inanimate physical entities, reasonably steady gradually. This indicates that there is little interaction between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (occupants and contents), and what is around it (the bigger environment). We typically see the frustrating bulk of the mass of product in a building as fairly unchanged physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of buildings can be viewed as the result of a complex set of vibrant interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological measurements. Structures can be explained and understood as intricate systems. Research using the methods ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Building ecology is proposed here as the application of those techniques to the constructed environment thinking about the dynamic system of buildings, their occupants, and the bigger environment.<p>
