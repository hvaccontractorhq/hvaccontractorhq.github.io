<p>SysTech Style concentrates on commercial ventilation applications, the most impactful engineering control method for improving and preserving the quality of the air in and around a commercial environment.

Condensed wetness can cause dust and other particles to adhere to and build up on the coils.

It also prevents water from building up on and underneath the coils, which can trigger mold issues.<p>

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>
