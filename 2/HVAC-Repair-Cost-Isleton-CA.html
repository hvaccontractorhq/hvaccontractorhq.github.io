There are emergency security switches that safeguard your cooling system from flooding. Among the most typical locations for emergency ac repair midtown Tx security changes is the float switch in your HVAC emergency drain pan. It is a good chance; you might have a water leak in the attic if your Nest is revealing a blank screen. The water triggers your emergency security switch, thus cutting power to your HVAC transformer.
