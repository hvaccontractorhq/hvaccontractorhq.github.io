<p>My eldest son constantly grumbled about how the AC was run-down and we needed to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did before. Weâ $ ve had the important things for 16 years so I didnâ $ t really think of anything else except replacing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is low and itâ $ s fantastic on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service contract attempts to upsell you whenever they come to carry out routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned in March 2015, why would they be revealing "extreme rust" in June 2015 and need a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount if she renewed her PMA for 7 years, although it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't need a air purification system, but they talked her into it.<p>
