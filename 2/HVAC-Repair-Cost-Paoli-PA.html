<p>Around The Clock Air Conditioning is as promised: readily available immediately to offer outstanding service. Ilan Cohavi, the owner, works neatly and effectively to provide a completed job in record time. He installed 3 Nest Knowing Thermostats in my home. His knowledge of the product was exceptional. His workmanship was outstanding and he didn't leave a mess. The reward: he is an extremely pleasant individual to work with, and is extremely eager to complete the work as per the specifications of his client. I would highly suggest him for all your HVAC requires.<p>
<p>The primary reason homeowners do not buy an HVAC service contract is the cost. They can cost between $150 and $500 annually, depending upon the amount of services offered. If the system is brand-new and still under a maker's warranty, the cost may not be beneficial. Any major repairs must be covered under the maker's guarantee. However, some producers need regular maintenance as a regard to the warranty.<p>
<p>What do you do when the company that's offering the service agreement attempts to upsell you each time they come to perform routine maintenance? If the coils were cleaned up in March 2015, why would they be showing "excessive rust" in June 2015 and require a deep cleaning for $400? They offered her a Reme Halo for $1,300, providing her a 10% discount rate if she restored her PMA for seven years, although it was 6 months prior to the current one ended. She didn't need a air filtration system, but they talked her into it.<p>
