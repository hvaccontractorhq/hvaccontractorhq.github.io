<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program personnel frequently gets requests for assessment and assistance in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) issues from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal companies. During the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) set up in the wall cavities of their houses as an energy conservation step. However, many of these houses were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde not long after the UFFI installation. Few houses are now being insulated with this product. Research studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; therefore, houses in which UFFI was set up several years back are not likely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>

Heat pumps work on electrical energy and work like air conditioning system in reverse, using a compressor to "pull" heat out of the outside air.

They can be connected to your existing ductwork, if you are replacing a gas or oil furnace.<p>

<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly used in dry cleaning. In lab studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned items are saved and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can conserve cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical throughout the pressing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking steps to lessen your exposure to this chemical is sensible. Do not accept them until they have been properly dried if dry-cleaned products have a strong chemical odor when you select them up. If goods with a chemical smell are returned to you on subsequent check outs, try a different dry cleaner.<p>

<p>Radiators are heat exchangers for cooling your automobile's internal combustion engine. A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the environment through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine might damage the engine elements. To prevent this from happening, have your radiator serviced regularly. To have your radiator needs managed by professionals, visit Acme Automobile Electric & Repair today.<p>
