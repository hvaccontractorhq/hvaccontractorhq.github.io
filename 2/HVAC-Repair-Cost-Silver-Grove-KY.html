<h3>Air Filter Replacement in Silver Grove KY</h3>
<p>I typically do not leave reviews but wanted to share my experience. You don't anticipate having to change your AC system. Regrettably for us, we had no other alternative. What made me choose this company was their interaction top to bottom. When I called they addressed. That goes a long method. Other companies would schedule a call and not recall. My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was professional going over my options. After service hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and discuss options. I scheduled my set up and the team (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the entire time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never ever felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a family good friend and now I will suggest this company to my friends.<p>
<p>Iâ $ m actually picky with my things. I like my devices and devices original, I wonâ $ t have anything to do with inexpensive knock-offs. So purchasing this air conditioner to replace my old one was somewhat of a difficult fact. You canâ $ t trust the commercial these days. Since it has restored my faith in excellent manufacturing, am pleased I got this though. I havenâ $ t had a problem with this new Carrier I got since I bought it 7 months earlier. Itâ $ s simply perfect.<p>
