<p>Scott performed the installation and did an excellent job locating the outdoor system as close to your house as possible per my request. The job took two days and my lawn and basement were left tidy during and after the work. Scott was very experienced of the system, performed a spick-and-span installation with the existing ductwork, and strolled us through the brand-new thermostat and how to dismantle our old oil furnace (we chose to keep it for my moms and dads' rental home that has a 80 years of age furnace.)
