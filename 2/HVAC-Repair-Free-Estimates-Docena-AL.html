<p>Now, there are a couple of common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you should keep an eye out for. First, you must examine your ac system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might seem a little absurd, but ice on your a/c unit can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally decrease the temperature around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat appropriately if entirely iced over.<p>
