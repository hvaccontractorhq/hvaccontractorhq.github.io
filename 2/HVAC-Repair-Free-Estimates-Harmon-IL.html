Bob's supplied a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, triggering the furnace to close down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was basic. Technician described the issue, the service and was on his way. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>The installation was fast, professional and extremely well done. The installers were polite and understood precisely what to do. I am an engineer by occupation and recognize quickly individuals who are proficient at what they do.

I extremely highly suggest the two gentlemen as they are excellent at what they do. Thank you to them as they certainly deserve my thanks and appreciation for a task well done.<p>
