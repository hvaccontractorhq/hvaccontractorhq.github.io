<p>I had a horrible experience with an HVAC company that charged $8,519 for installing a furnace cost $1,300. Furthermore, the company used 98% of the existing product acquired with your home.

<h3>Is The Furnace Running Top Efficiency in Orchard Park NY?</h3>
<p>So it turned out that whatever they did was 100% inspection, not 'servicing' (its not like a 'vehicle oil modification' kind of maintenance as I've read here). The heat exchanger had an extremely small bubble on the surface which the tech stated 'might' cause a problem in the future. So he said I might swap it out now or leave it and have it changed when the heat broke. In any case it was going to be the very same cost (it never broke).<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have actually discovered them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do fine work. When they installed my primary furnace they went well beyond what was required and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the hot water heater due to the fact that the service technicians thought they just didn't seem best and they couldn't leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
