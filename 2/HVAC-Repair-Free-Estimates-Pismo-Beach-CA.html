<p>How environment modification impacts air quality and direct exposure to air pollutants. In a thermodynamically closed system, any power dissipated into the system that is being preserved at a set temperature level (which is a basic modus operandi for modern-day ac system) needs that the rate of energy elimination by the air conditioner increase. This boost has the result that, for each unit of energy input into the system (state to power a light bulb in the closed system), the a/c eliminates that energy. 39 To do so, the air conditioning unit should increase its power consumption by the inverse of its "performance" (coefficient of efficiency) times the amount of power dissipated into the system. As an example, presume that inside the closed system a 100 W heating element is triggered, and the a/c has a coefficient of efficiency of 200%. The air conditioning unit's power intake will increase by 50 W to compensate for this, thus making the 100 W heating component cost an overall of 150 W of power.<p>
