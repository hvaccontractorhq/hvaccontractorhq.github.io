<p>Recent Review: I've changed to Bob's from my previous supplier due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are comprehensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung around working out the issue. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician spent a good quantity of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as a prevention measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
