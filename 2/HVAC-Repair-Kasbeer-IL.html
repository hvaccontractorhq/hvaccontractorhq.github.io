<h3>Central Air Conditioning Repair in Kasbeer Illinois</h3>
<p>Truth: Geothermal systems actually consume no water. If an aquifer is used to exchange heat with the earth, all the water is gone back to that same aquifer.

When used commercially, geothermal HVAC systems really eliminate countless gallons of water that would otherwise have been vaporized in cooling towers in conventional systems.<p>
<p>Even if your central air conditioner is just eight to ten years old, it might suck up to two times the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it operates at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a specific cooling output. Until 2006, 10 SEER was standard, however these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That equates to 30% less electrical usage and 30% lower cooling expenses than devices installed simply a few years back.<p>
