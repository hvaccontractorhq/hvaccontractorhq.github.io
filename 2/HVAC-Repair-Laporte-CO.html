<p>A geothermal heater does not generate its power by burning nonrenewable fuel sources such as coal, oil, or gas. Instead, it soaks up heat from within the earth.

<p>Many central air conditioning conditioners are linked to a house's forced-air circulation system. Hence, the same motor, blower, and ductwork used for heating are utilized to distribute cool air from the cooling system. When a central air conditioning conditioner is operating, hot air inside your house streams to the furnace through the return-air duct. The hot air is moved by the blower across the cooled evaporator coil in the plenum and is then provided through ducts to cool your home. When the ac system works but your house does not cool, the problem is most likely in the circulation system.<p>
