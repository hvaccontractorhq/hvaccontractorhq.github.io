<h3>The Benefits of Routine HVAC Maintenance at Pelion SC</h3>
<p>With the split system, the evaporator coil is connected to a remote condenser system utilizing refrigerant piping in between a outdoor and indoor system instead of ducting air directly from the outside unit. Indoor systems with directional vents mount onto walls, suspended from ceilings, or fit into the ceiling. Other indoor units mount inside the ceiling cavity, so that short lengths of duct manage air from the indoor unit to vents or diffusers around the rooms.<p>
<p>The bottom line is to safeguard your investment by only utilizing the services of a certified contractor or a licensed representative from a service or seller to do the installation. If you select to attempt to do it yourself, or work with a non-licensed individual to do the work, in many, if not all cases, you will void the service warranty for the cooling system. A voided warranty will not do you any excellent should the system fail or malfunction. Do it right from the get-go and hire a certified person with the experience to install the system.<p>
