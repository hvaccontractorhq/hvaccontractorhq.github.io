<p>The contaminants noted in this guide have been shown to trigger the health impacts pointed out. However, it is not necessarily true that the effects kept in mind take place at the pollutant concentration levels normally found in the house. In a lot of cases, our understanding of the contaminants and their health effects is too limited to identify the levels at which the listed impacts could occur.<p>
<p>Weatherization generally does not trigger indoor air problems by adding new pollutants to the air. (There are a couple of exceptions, such as caulking, that can often give off contaminants.)

As a result, after weatherization, concentrations of indoor air toxins from sources inside the home can increase.<p>
