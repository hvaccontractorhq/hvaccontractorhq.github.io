<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most widely utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has actually been revealed to cause cancer in animals. Recent studies suggest that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned goods are kept and as they wear dry-cleaned clothes. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning procedure so they can save cash by re-using it, and they get rid of more of the chemical during the pushing and ending up procedures. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to reduce your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned items have a strong chemical smell when you select them up, do not accept them up until they have been properly dried. If goods with a chemical odor are returned to you on subsequent check outs, attempt a various dry cleaner.<p>
