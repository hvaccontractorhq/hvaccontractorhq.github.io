<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter climates where the temperature is frequently in the variety of 4-13 Â° C (40-55 Â° F), because heat pumps become inefficient in more extreme cold. This is because ice types on the outside system's heat exchanger coil, which blocks air circulation over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system should momentarily change back into the regular air conditioning mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heat pump systems will for that reason have a kind of electric resistance heating in the indoor air path that is triggered only in this mode in order to make up for the temporary indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter season.<p>
