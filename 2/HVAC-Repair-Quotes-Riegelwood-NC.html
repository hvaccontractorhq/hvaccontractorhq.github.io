<h3>Three Crucial Spring Furnace Maintenance Tips in Riegelwood NC</h3>
<p>During winter, the ground source heat is soaked up by pumping a water-based and anti-freeze solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid circulates around this loop, transferring the absorbed heat to a refrigerant via the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it passes through the compressor, increasing the temperature of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the home's central heating unit.<p>
<p>Dichlorodifluoromethane (R-12) was the most typical mix utilized in automobiles in the U.S. until 1994, when most styles changed to R-134A due to the ozone-depleting potential of R-12. R-11 and R-12 are no longer made in the U.S. for this kind of application, but is still imported and can be bought and used by licensed HVAC professionals. For systems requiring only an occasional "shot" of R-12 and otherwise in great working order and performing far much better than practically all "R-134a" systems whether "transformed" or "factory", even $50-$ 100 per pound of R-12 is considered "cheap" by many individuals.<p>
