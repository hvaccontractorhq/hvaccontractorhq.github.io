<p>Particulate matter (PM)-- Found both inside and outside, particulate matter is a mixture of liquid beads and solid particles suspended in the air, such as dust, smoke, pollen, and soot. The particles themselves are different sizes, however the ones to be most worried about are the tiniest-- 10 micrometers in diameter or smaller sized-- since they can be inhaled. Inhalation of PM can affect the heart and lungs. Outdoor PM, produced by building, for instance, or the burning of nonrenewable fuel sources, enters into buildings via natural and mechanical ventilation. Inside your home it can be produced by fireplaces, cigarette smoking, or other activities.<p>
<p>Ventilation plays an essential role in indoor air quality. According to the EPA, ventilation is a mix of processes which leads to the supply and removal of air from inside a building." Those procedures consist of generating outdoors air, conditioning it and blending it with indoor air, dispersing that air throughout the structure, and moving some part of indoor air outside. If several of these procedures are underperforming, the quality of indoor air will be affected.<p>
