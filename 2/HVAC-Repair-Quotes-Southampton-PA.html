<p>Called WSE for a routine inspection. The tech showed up right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the visit. They advised changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't cheap however a fast internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I happily had them changed. However, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>Sean was very helpful. He is a very enjoyable individual to deal with. No pressure applied to buy extra things. Addressed all the concerns that I had. I had a 41- blower motor fault. Had the ability to come at 8 AM. He was able to put rise protectors on the system and do the full maintenance on the system. that was to ensure they were no concerns aside from the blower motor.
