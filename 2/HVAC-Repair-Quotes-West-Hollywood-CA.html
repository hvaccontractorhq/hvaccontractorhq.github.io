<h3>High Efficiency Furnace in West Hollywood CA</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are measured in heaps. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your home. For example, a 1 load unit will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Units) per hour. With every 1 increase in tons, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This indicates a 4.5 heap unit will cool 54,000 BTUs.

<p>The liquid refrigerant is returned to another heat exchanger where it is permitted to evaporate, hence the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant evaporates it takes in heat from the within air, returns to the compressor, and duplicates the cycle. In the process, heat is absorbed from inside your home and transferred outdoors, leading to cooling of the building.<p>
<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the whole living space. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outside air) and air cleaning help identify the efficiency of dilution. Air modifications arise from a combination of natural ventilation (seepage; leakage; windows) and mechanical (regulated) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The goal is to provide sufficient changes to guarantee a healthy environment. There are a number of types of heating and cooling systems with purification that can be set up to accomplish this. A typical component necessary in all systems is duct sealing, especially on the return side (side illustration in the air). The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) provides assistance on duct sealing in its Manual D: Duct Design.<p>
