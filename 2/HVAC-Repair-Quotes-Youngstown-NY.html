<p>Capacitors - Single-phase motors in air-conditioning systems utilize capacitors to start the compressor. The capacitor stores energy, like a battery does, to have power readily available to the compressor when the thermostat tells it to switch on.

<p>Lots of AC systems feature a number of unique functions that can further enhance efficiency and efficiency. For instance, homeowners might want to search for one that features an integrated filter light that will notify you when the air filter needs to be changed.
