A radiator cools the engine by flowing an engine coolant through the engine block - it then loses the heat to the atmosphere through radiation. A radiator has a set of tubes through which the engine coolant streams. Fins surround these tubes. When the radiator fails, the excess heat produced by the engine could harm the engine components. To prevent this from taking place, have your radiator serviced routinely. To have your radiator needs handled by experts, see Eric's Garage today.<p>
