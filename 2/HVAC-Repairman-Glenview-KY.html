As discussed above, a BTU is a traditional unit of heat; it is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature level of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.

<p>The directions that featured the mat and thermostat were so darn good we felt comfortable completing the circuitry of the thermostat and mat. We left setting up the new breaker and final connections in the main circuit panel to a local electrical contractor. We recommend you do the very same. Once the circuitry is complete, stimulate the system for a couple of minutes to make certain the controls work and resistance cable television heats up. Do not put the system into full operation up until the thin-set and grout have actually had time to correctly treat and solidify-- generally two to 4 weeks. Then call the family together and play a video game of Scrabble on your cozy, warm restroom flooring.<p>
