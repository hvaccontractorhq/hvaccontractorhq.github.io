<p>Illinois Department of Public Health Toxicology Program staff often receives ask for assessment and help in attending to indoor air quality (IAQ) concerns from the public, other department staff, and local, state, and federal agencies. Throughout the 1970s, many homeowners had urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) installed in the wall cavities of their homes as an energy preservation step. However, much of these homes were found to have fairly high indoor concentrations of formaldehyde right after the UFFI installation. Few homes are now being insulated with this product. Studies show that formaldehyde emissions from UFFI decrease with time; for that reason, homes in which UFFI was installed several years back are unlikely to have high levels of formaldehyde now.<p>
<p>HVAC Systems Can Contribute to Air Quality Problems. HVAC systems can also worsen indoor air quality problems. The HVAC system may be polluted (due to the fact that of mold in duct lining or bacteria on coil or filters, for example), and the system may spread out these pollutants throughout the home.
