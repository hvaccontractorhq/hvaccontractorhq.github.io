<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more tough to manage than they seem due to factors such as heat gains from sunshine, outside conditions, and the outside air ventilation rate. ASHRAE advises temperatures ranging from 68.5 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and from 75 to 80.5 degrees in the summer; indoor relative humidity should be kept at or below 65%. The EPA suggests humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to decrease mold development.<p>
<p>Consider possible effects of indoor air contamination if you utilize an unvented kerosene or gas area heating system. Follow the manufacturer's directions, specifically directions on the correct fuel and keeping the heater effectively adjusted. A consistent yellow-tipped flame is typically a sign of maladjustment and increased pollutant emissions. While a space heating unit is in use, open a door from the room where the heater lies to the remainder of the home and open a window a little.<p>
