<h3>Effective Tips for Furnace Cleaning at Rex GA</h3>
<p>Changed a 75 Gallon Water heater with a High Efficiency (97%) Phoenix Light Task 50 gallon water heater. It went terrific. Dealing with Braxten was a pleasure. We got a quote for 3 different water heaters. Two on demand tankless and one high performance tank. The crew took the entire day as they needed to remove the old water heater and set up all brand-new venting, gas lines for the brand-new high performance heating unit. We decided on getting something more expensive than a standard water heater as gas is one of our most significant energy expenditures. We feel that this new system will last a long time and use really little energy to heat water.<p>
<p>4 Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, timely and do great work.

No additional charge.<p>
