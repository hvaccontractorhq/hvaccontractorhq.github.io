If the valves on the water pipe entering and the pipes leaving the traditional water heater are closed and the bypass valve is open, water will flow from the solar tank past the conventional water heater.

<p>Seattle heating systems can run 9 months of the year. Based on the average temperatures in our area, if you compared running your furnace to a cars and truck it would get the equivalent of 1.8 million miles over its expected life expectancy of 15 years.

<p>Inadequate maintenance of the HVAC system also might add to indoor air quality problems. Ventilation system filters that are not changed on a regular basis may become clogged, lowering air circulation quality, distribution, and volume. They also might become locations for germs and molds to grow and be dispersed throughout the home. Humidifier systems on HVAC systems also need to be appropriately preserved to prevent germs and mold contamination.<p>
<p>Nearly half of Americans use air fresheners a minimum of once a week, and 34 percent use candle lights or incense that frequently, our nationally representative study discovered. Approximately 40 percent rarely or never clean their humidifier or kitchen area range hood, though they use it daily. One quarter have never cleaned up or replaced their furnace filter. And almost 20 percent still smoke in your home or let others smoke there. All of those things can get worse indoor air quality.<p>
