<p>Buildings are developed or meant to respond actively to a few of these changes in and around them with heating, cooling, ventilating, air cleaning or illuminating systems.

<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a procedure called free cooling which utilizes pumps to distribute a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mixture from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is gotten rid of from the cooled space. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heatpump is included due to the fact that the temperature of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, thus decreasing its efficiency.<p>
