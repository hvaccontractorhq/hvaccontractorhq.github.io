<p>Dometic's commercial grade rooftop air conditioning unit are performance-tested to overcome unusual or harsh roadway and weather. Numerous basic units break down after simply 4 hours of extreme vibration screening, while the Vigorous II is still going strong at 30 hours and more!

<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odorless gas that aggravates the mucous membranes in the nose, eye, and throat and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is evidence that high concentrations or continued direct exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the threat of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal research studies that repeated direct exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels may lead, or contribute, to the development of lung illness such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide consist of children and people with asthma and other breathing diseases.<p>
<p>People operating in structures with bad IAQ might see undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some workers complain about signs that take place at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more serious problem. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have been linked to IAQ issues. If you have symptoms that are not disappearing or are worsening, talk with your doctor about them. But not all direct exposures trigger signs, so there is no substitute for good structure management.<p>
