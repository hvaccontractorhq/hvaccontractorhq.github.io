<h3>Clogged Air Filters in Lynnwood Washington</h3>
<p>My home has 5 systems, less than 2 years old. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a starting capacitor for $45.00 (discovered it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another need the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a shop vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I complained and got a refund) When this guy belittled me for my "not understanding", I threw him off the residential or commercial property.<p>

<p>Replacing a capacitor is simple. Just take a photo of the wires prior to detaching anything (you might require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the saved energy in the old capacitor (Image 4). Usage needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. Remove the connector and flex the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab if it's not. When you've switched all the wires, protect the new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
