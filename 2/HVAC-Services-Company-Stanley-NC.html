<h3>Ventilation Double Flux in Stanley NC</h3>
<p>Some air conditioning systems have the alternative to reverse the refrigeration cycle and function as heat pumps, for that reason producing heating instead of cooling in the indoor environment. They are also commonly described as "reverse cycle air conditioner". The heatpump is considerably more energy efficient than electric resistance heating, due to the fact that it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil switches roles and becomes the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes roles to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (chillier than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Asthmatic kids are especially at risk. EPA estimates that direct exposure to previously owned smoke increases the number of episodes and seriousness of signs in hundreds of thousands of asthmatic children, and might cause countless nonasth-matic kids to develop the illness each year. EPA estimates that in between 200,000 and 1,000,000 asthmatic kids have their condition intensified by direct exposure to secondhand smoke each year. Direct exposure to secondhand smoke causes throat, eye, and nose inflammation. It may impact the cardiovascular system and some research studies have linked exposure to pre-owned smoke with the onset of chest pain. For publications about ETS, go to the IAQ Publications page, or contact EPA's Indoor Air Quality Info Clearinghouse (IAQ INFO), 800-438-4318 or (703) 356-4020.<p>
