<p>The split system is the most typical. Most people are used to seeing this enter the yards of houses. With split system units, the majority of the elements are housed in a metal box outside of the home. Nevertheless, there are some internal parts too. Split systems are perfect for cooling several rooms at the same time, but are not really energy effective. For that reason, one pro is not having loud equipment in the house. At the same time, the con would be that those who utilize this may spend more cash on cooling costs in the long run since of the lower energy effectiveness.<p>
