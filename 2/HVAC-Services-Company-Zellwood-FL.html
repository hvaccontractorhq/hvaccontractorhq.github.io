Some systems with little storages are hybrids, utilizing totally free cooling early in the cooling season, and later on using a heat pump to chill the circulation coming from the storage.

<p>It is common to assume that buildings are merely inanimate physical entities, relatively steady with time. This suggests that there is little interaction in between the triad of the structure, what remains in it (residents and contents), and what is around it (the larger environment). We typically see the frustrating majority of the mass of material in a building as relatively the same physical product over time. In fact, the true nature of structures can be viewed as the result of a complex set of dynamic interactions among their physical, chemical, and biological dimensions. Buildings can be described and understood as complex systems. Research applying the approaches ecologists use to the understanding of communities can help increase our understanding. Structure ecology is proposed here as the application of those approaches to the constructed environment considering the vibrant system of buildings, their residents, and the bigger environment.<p>
