<p>Barbara, I am an HVAC contractor in Norfolk, Va. You should have annual maintenance done on the Combi boiler you had installed. The heat exchanger passages have really little passages and can get fouled without maintenance flushing. Relating to the vehicle debit, although my company does not provide automobile debit lots of companies do so they can have a recognized quantity of cash coming in every month, it assists with capital and having a "bumper" during the slow times of the year. , if we do choose to provide automobile debit we would also have a choice of a single payment for the Service Arrangement.. There should not be any reason why your company can not provide this. Hope this assists.<p>

<p>Because it has to run longer than a properly sized system, an undersize unit won't be able to cool spaces down entirely on the hottest days and will cost more to run. Since it simply takes more electrical energy to run a larger unit, a large-scale compressor also costs more to operate. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity efficiently. That's due to the fact that it cools the air so rapidly that it shuts off before it has a chance to circulate the correct volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary moisture. The result is a room that does not seem as cool as the temperature suggests. In fact, the space can feel clammy and damp.<p>
