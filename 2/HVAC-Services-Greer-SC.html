<p>A pure maintenance agreement is not worth the paper it is composed on. Every technician will tell you clean the filters, take a hose pipe two times a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the registers a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your home.

You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
