<p>Current Review: I am extremely pleased with Bob's Heating and Air Conditioning. My a/c unit broke and they came out the next day. They discovered the issue and changed the part and everything works fine now. Their service person, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He offered me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He took the time to explain everything on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioner and servicing the furnace. He was courteous and well-informed. I was charged a fair rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

The dehumidifier will keep your relative humidity at a comfy level, improving indoor air quality and enabling greater comfort at greater temperature levels.<p>
