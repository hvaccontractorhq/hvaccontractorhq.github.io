<p>RMI is working to alter that, starting in California. As an initial step, in April RMI affirmed prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the company to set more powerful indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to regulate indoor devices through codes, and after more powerful standards are set there is an opportunity to work on enforcement.<p>
<p>Co2 concentrations increase as a result of human occupancy, however lag in time behind cumulative occupancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air exchange rate, the slower the accumulation of co2 to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK assistance are based. Therefore, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation need to be made after an extended duration of stable occupancy and ventilation - in schools a minimum of 2 hours, and in workplaces at least 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to determine co2 need to be adjusted often, and outside measurements utilized for calculations ought to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature impacts on measurements made outdoors may also be necessary.<p>
