A key part of the program is reacting to and solving issues of building occupants about problems in their workplace.<p>
<p>Before you head out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a couple of things to decide initially. Where are you going to be installing the a/c? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you wish to set up some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning unit be? Too large and you'll face problems with short-cycling, which can damage the air conditioning system and shorten its life. Too small and your a/c won't have the ability to cool the house appropriately. When shopping for a new AC system, these are simply a few of the aspects that you need to take into account. Each choice can and will substantially affect your system's performance, which is why you can't manage to disregard any of them.<p>
