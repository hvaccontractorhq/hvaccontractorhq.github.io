<h3>Ductless AC System in Washington Mississippi</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular evaluation. The tech showed up right on time and was well-informed & friendly throughout the check out. They recommended changing a couple of parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a fast web search confirmed WSE wasn't inflating rates, so I gladly had them replaced. Nevertheless, a week later the furnace stopped working. I called and a tech was able to squeeze us in very same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was faulty. No charge for the check out or the brand-new part. I was extremely pleased they stood by their work and repaired the issue. Will certainly be utilizing them once again.<p>

<p>A/c can create a lot of water due to the fact that they eliminate wetness from the air. To eliminate this, they have a typically plastic drain pipe that comes out of the side of the air handler. Over time, algae can obstruct this pipe and, when it does, the AC won't work. In fact, some condensate drains have a float switch that won't let the AC run if water backs-up. Water can also puddle around the system or flood the area. To handle condensate issues, please see Air conditioning unit Leaks Water, below.<p>
