<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a need for air conditioner repair, which you should look out for. First, you need to check your air conditioning unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be an indication that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If totally iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat properly.<p>
