<p>Recent Review: I've switched to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two technicians I've had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and hung around exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned up the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was triggering the power to shut down to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a location in the unit, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention procedure. The repair at that point was basic. Technician described the problem, the service and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
