<p>The term radiant heat covers a number of different system types. Most typical are boilers, which are described hydronic radiant heat systems, and electric systems, which are typically described as just glowing systems. Electric radiant heating systems have actually heating components installed in the subfloor of each room in the house, periodically connected to terminal units like baseboard heating units. When the system remains in usage, the central generator runs an electrical current through the heating aspects throughout your house. Heat radiates out from the heating aspects, through the flooring, and into the space. This is why the approach is described as radiant heating.<p>
