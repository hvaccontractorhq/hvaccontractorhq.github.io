<h3>Electric Furnace in Lisle IL</h3>
<p>Central air conditioning systems are determined in loads. This measurement is based on the unit's ability to cool your house. For instance, a 1 ton system will cool 12,000 BTUs (British Thermal Systems) per hour. With every 1 boost in loads, the BTUs increase by 12,000. This means a 4.5 lot system will cool 54,000 BTUs. If you aren't familiar with the term BTU, it means the amount of energy required to cool or heat a pound of water by one degree F °.<p>
<p>Carbon dioxide concentrations increase as a result of human tenancy, however lag in time behind cumulative tenancy and intake of fresh air. The lower the air currency exchange rate, the slower the buildup of carbon dioxide to quasi "stable state" concentrations on which the NIOSH and UK guidance are based. For that reason, measurements of carbon dioxide for purposes of evaluating the adequacy of ventilation require to be made after an extended duration of stable tenancy and ventilation - in schools at least 2 hours, and in workplaces a minimum of 3 hours - for concentrations to be a sensible indicator of ventilation adequacy. Portable instruments utilized to measure co2 should be adjusted regularly, and outdoor measurements utilized for computations need to be made close in time to indoor measurements. Corrections for temperature effects on measurements made outdoors might also be needed.<p>
<p>Indoor temperature levels are often more challenging to manage than they seem due to aspects such as heat gains from sunshine, outdoor conditions, and the outdoor air ventilation rate.

The EPA advises humidity levels of between 30% and 60% to lower mold growth.<p>
