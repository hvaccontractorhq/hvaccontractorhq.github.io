Opening doors and windows, running window or attic fans, when the weather condition allows, or running a window a/c unit with the vent control open increases the outdoor ventilation rate. Local restroom or kitchen fans that tire outdoors get rid of pollutants directly from the room where the fan lies and also increase the outside air ventilation rate.<p>
<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take a picture of the wires before detaching anything (you may require a reference later). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Picture 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the matching tab of the new capacitor. The female crimp adapters must snap firmly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, get rid of the connector and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. When you've switched all the wires, secure the brand-new capacitor (Image 5).<p>
