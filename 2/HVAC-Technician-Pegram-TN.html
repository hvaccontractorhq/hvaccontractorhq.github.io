<p>My oldest son always complained about how the AC was run-down and we required to get a brand-new one. For a long time I dismissed him however then I recognized that it really didnâ $ t disperse air like it did previously. Weâ $ ve had the thing for 16 years so I didnâ $ t actually think about anything else except changing it. The one I got is worth every cent. The sound level is itâ and low $ s excellent on energy conserving too.<p>
<p>Due to the fact that my furnace was not working, I called Snowflake Air. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose spent time repairing the problem, all the while explaining whatever to me. After discovering the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the appropriate replacement. After the installation of the brand-new thermostat, Jose discussed the operation and programing to me. I will certainly use Snowflake Air in the future.<p>
