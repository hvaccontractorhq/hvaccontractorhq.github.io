There can be a serious risk from the cumulative results of these sources. Luckily, there are actions that the majority of people can take both to decrease the threat from existing sources and to prevent brand-new problems from occurring.

<p>Cooling can also be provided by a procedure called totally free cooling which uses pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn acts as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Common storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with little storage capability are hybrid systems, using free cooling early in the cooling season, and later using a heat pump to chill the blood circulation coming from the storage.
