<p>Have utilized the very same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems two times a year. They provide me top priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and dual zone system from them after getting 3 bids. Never buy prolonged service warranties or service arrangements on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summertime. Good financial investment in my opinion. Never ever attempt to sell me something I do not need.<p>
