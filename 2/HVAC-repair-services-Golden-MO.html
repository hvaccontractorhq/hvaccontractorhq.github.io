<p>To the HVAC owner who stated they recover cost on service contracts - cut me a break. , if they weren't profitable you wouldn't use them.. Second of all like extended auto guarantees they tend to cost a lot and cover really little and let's face it most of the companies coming out to do the yearly service try to upsell you which is truly sad. Although the saddest thing is the lack of professionalism in the trades today in North NJ. Too many folks lack the necessary skills to do the job and also the morals to deal with consumers fairly. As a client you require to be well informed in order not to be completely made the most of. Many companies would rather offer you a new AC of furnace than to effectively service the system you have. Called out 3 companies - all with the very same pitch to sell new versus repair. Lastly discovered someone to properly service and the system has been operating issue complimentary for the past 2+ years. Homewoner beware.<p>
