<p>An undersize unit will not have the ability to cool rooms down completely on the hottest days and will cost more to operate since it has to run longer than a correctly sized unit. An oversize compressor also costs more to run since it simply takes more electrical power to run a bigger system. And a large-scale unit doesn't lower humidity successfully. That's because it cools the air so quickly that it turns off before it has a chance to flow the proper volume of air past the coils to extract the necessary wetness. The outcome is a room that does not appear as cool as the temperature level suggests. In truth, the space can feel moist and clammy.<p>

<p>Biological impurities consist of bacteria, molds, mildew, infections, animal dander and cat saliva, home dust mites, cockroaches, and pollen. There are numerous sources of these toxins. Pollens originate from plants; viruses are sent by people and animals; bacteria are brought by people, animals, and soil and plant particles; and household animals are sources of saliva and animal dander. The protein in urine from mice and rats is a powerful allergen. It can end up being air-borne when it dries. Infected central air conditioning handling systems can become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other sources of biological contaminants and can then disperse these impurities through the house.<p>
