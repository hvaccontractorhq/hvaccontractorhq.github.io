<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in leading shape, be aware that there are maintenance items that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For instance, a sluggish refrigerant leakage in your AC system can result in costly compressor failure, however a house owner does not have the tools or skills needed to examine refrigerant levels. Likewise, clean ducts and appropriate airflow are vital to a well-functioning system, but homeowners do not have the needed devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy homeowner, it's still required to have an expert technician inspect the system regularly.<p>

The next step is to thaw your air conditioning devices if you discovered that your conditioning filter requires changing. The simplest method to defrost your HVAC devices is to leave the unit off for a few hours, with the blower fan running.<p>
