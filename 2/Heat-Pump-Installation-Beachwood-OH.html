<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous service provider due to the fact that the two specialists I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, knowledgeable, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's supplied a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they eliminated the blower and cleaned up the ducts.

The technician spent a decent quantity of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a location in the unit, triggering the furnace to close down as an avoidance step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician explained the issue, the option and was on his way. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
