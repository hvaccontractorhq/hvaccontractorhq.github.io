<p>Have used the same company for 6 years to service my 3 units twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have issues. Bought a brand-new primary system and dual zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never buy extended guarantees or service contracts on anything but HVAC. Sucks not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer. Great investment in my viewpoint. Never try to sell me something I don't require.<p>
