<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heating systems and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly servicing. I have actually discovered them to be fairly priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was required and redid the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater because the technicians thought they just didn't appear best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
