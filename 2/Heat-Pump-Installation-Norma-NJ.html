<p>Before you go out and purchase an a/c unit, there are a few things to choose initially. Where are you going to be setting up the air conditioning system? If your house is not outfitted with ductwork, do you want to install some or go ductless? How big should the air conditioning unit be? Too big and you'll run into issues with short-cycling, which can harm the air conditioning system and shorten its life. Too little and your a/c won't have the ability to cool your home effectively. When going shopping for a new AC system, these are just a few of the aspects that you need to take into account.
