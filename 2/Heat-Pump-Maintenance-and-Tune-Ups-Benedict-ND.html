This is typically used in a third-floor or 2nd location and takes advantage of the floor joist cavities while avoiding the cost, weight and additional thickness of an in-screed concrete pour. To make an under-timber glowing floor heat hydronic system efficient, the joist locations are insulated with fiberglass batts, and foil reflectors are set up under the pipelines to direct heat up.<p>
