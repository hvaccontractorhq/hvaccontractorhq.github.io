Was able to come at 8 AM. He had the ability to put surge protectors on the unit and do the complete maintenance on the unit. that was to ensure they were no issues aside from the blower motor. The only reason he might not set up the new blower motor was because there was not one on hand. He will come tomorrow and set up that, now that he understands for sure what the problem is.<p>
<p>Four Seasons has actually set up both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned up the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be fairly priced, timely and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was needed and renovated the entire plenum and the duct for the water heater since the specialists thought they simply didn't seem right and they could not leave them that method. No extra charge.<p>
