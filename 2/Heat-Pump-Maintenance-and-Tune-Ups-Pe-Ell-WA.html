<p>The purpose of a lot of structure ventilation systems is to bring in appropriate fresh air for occupant convenience while managing temperature, humidity, and indoor air quality for workers and developing security at sensible energy costs. Your furnace has many elements that can impact the health and safety of you and your loved ones. Having a total check of your furnace will provide assurance that it is safe to operate. Paragon Heating & House Convenience Solutions Combustion Optimization & Safety Assessment of your furnace includes a Health & Security Analysis, which examines the heat exchanger (carbon monoxide leakages and infected breathing air), checks the pilot security (explosion risk), checks the high limit (fire danger) and includes a visual assessment for other hazards.
