<p>I've changed to Bob's from my previous company since the two professionals I have actually had out for service are extensive, friendly, educated, neat, and hung out working out the problem. Bob's offered a complete cleaning after a remodel kicked up a lot of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace quickly after kicking on. The technician invested a decent amount of time tracking down the problem and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose developing a hot spot in the system, causing the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The fix at that point was simple. Technician described the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>

<p>Factors that can contribute to the development of biological impurities are wet or wet structure products (carpeting, ceilings, walls) and badly preserved humidifiers, dehumidifiers, and a/c. "Humidifier fever" is a typical disease brought on by improper maintenance of humidifiers that can produce fever, chills, headaches, and relentless coughs.

Other possible sources of biological impurities are pets and home plants.<p>

<p>People operating in buildings with bad IAQ might discover undesirable or musty smells or might feel that the building is hot and stuffy. Some employees grumble about symptoms that happen at work and disappear when they leave work, like having headaches or feeling tired. Fever, cough, and shortness of breath can be signs of a more major issue. Asthma and some reasons for pneumonia (for example, Legionnaires' Illness and Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis) have actually been connected to IAQ issues. If you have signs that are not disappearing or are getting worse, speak to your physician about them. But not all exposures trigger symptoms, so there is no substitute for excellent building management.<p>
