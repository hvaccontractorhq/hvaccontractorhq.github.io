<p>I admit I haven't done the mathematics recently, however I have actually had a service agreement on my furnace and AC for over 25 years. It's spent for some repairs in addition to regular evaluations. Also, when my furnace was condemned one November the company responded right now, and when I changed my AC, they made 2 journeys to collaborate their work with a company that was dealing with the outdoor patio where the system sits. I seem like they give me preferential treatment, and am willing to pay a little bit more for that peace of mind.<p>
