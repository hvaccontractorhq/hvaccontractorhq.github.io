<h3>Air Duct Cleaning in Summertown TN</h3>
<p>Some a/c systems have the option to reverse the refrigeration cycle and serve as heat pumps, therefore producing heating rather of cooling in the indoor environment. They are likewise typically referred to as "reverse cycle air conditioning unit". The heatpump is significantly more energy effective than electric resistance heating, since it moves energy from air or groundwater to the heated space, as well as the heat from acquired electrical energy. When the heatpump is in heating mode, the indoor evaporator coil changes roles and ends up being the condenser coil, producing heat. The outdoor condenser system likewise changes functions to act as the evaporator, and discharges cold air (colder than the ambient outside air).<p>
<p>Air conditioning can also be offered by a process called totally free cooling which utilizes pumps to flow a coolant such as air, water, or a water- glycol mix from a cold source, which in turn functions as a heat sink for the energy that is eliminated from the cooled area. Typical storage media are cool outside air, deep aquifers, or a natural underground rock mass accessed via a cluster of small-diameter boreholes. Some systems with small storage capability are hybrid systems, utilizing complimentary cooling early in the cooling season, and later on utilizing a heatpump to chill the blood circulation originating from the storage. The heat pump is added because the temperature level of the storage slowly increases during the cooling season, consequently declining its effectiveness.<p>
