<h3>Heating System Repair in Burlington Kentucky</h3>
<p>My "C" score is based as follows: An A" for the technician. A D" for the Bryant heatpump. The unit runs quietly and effectively, but to have two significant parts fail in 3 1/2 years does not speak well for Bryant dependability. An F" for $616 in labor expenses (thaw control board installation $240, fan motor installation $376). These expenses were listed on the billing before work began. Parts were covered by warranty. Tax added another $53. The work was completed in less than two hours ($ 300+ per hour).<p>
<p>Energy performance can be enhanced even more in central heating systems by introducing zoned heating. This allows a more granular application of heat, comparable to non-central heater. Zones are controlled by several thermostats. In water heater the thermostats manage zone valves, and in forced air systems they control zone dampers inside the vents which selectively obstruct the flow of air. In this case, the control system is extremely vital to keeping a correct temperature level.<p>
