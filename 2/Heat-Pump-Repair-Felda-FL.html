<p>Ask about training and accreditations. An excellent place to begin is the North American Technician Excellence (NATE) accreditation.

Managers with BPI certification understand that the home is a system and see HVAC equipment as just one aspect (out of many) of a comfy environment.<p>
<p>The cost for heatpump installation likewise depends upon the size of the system and whether it is a single-room or whole-home system. A single-room air-to-air system can cost as low as $500, consisting of installation. Whole-house units, on the other hand, range in cost from $2,500 to $7,500, including installation. Geothermal heat pumps normally need excavation to set up, which includes several thousand dollars to the cost.<p>
<p>A geothermal HVAC is not the same as geothermal energy though, and the two need to not be confused. Where a geothermal HVAC take advantage of the heat inside the earth for space heating, cooling or for heating one's water supply, geothermal energy is the procedure by which the heat inside the earth is utilized for generating power in the type of electrical energy. The two operations use different procedures, with geothermal energy needing water be heated to boiling point to achieve its objectives.<p>
