Then make certain the furnace filter is clean Then go clean and outside off the condenser coils (Picture 2). If numerous signs up were closed or the filter was blocked, the lowered air flow might have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your home. If you've changed the filter and opened all the registers and you're still not getting air flow at the registers, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Vehicle" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of 30 minutes or up until there's great air flow at the registers.
