Simply put, the outdoor system will distribute all its power to all operating indoor systems in such a way that some of the spaces may not have a really comfortable temperature level.

<p>I have actually changed to Bob's from my previous provider due to the fact that the two technicians I have actually had out for service are thorough, friendly, educated, tidy, and spent time working out the issue. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they removed the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace soon after kicking on. The technician spent a decent amount of time tracking down the issue and after much head scratching, discovered a thermometer's insulation was coming lose creating a hot spot in the unit, causing the furnace to close down as an avoidance measure. The repair at that point was easy. Technician discussed the problem, the option and was on his method. Charged only for the diagnostic.<p>
