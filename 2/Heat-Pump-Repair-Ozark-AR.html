<p>When your HVAC professional informs you to alter your filters routinely, they're not kidding. It's as crucial as a regular oil change in your cars and truck. A dirty filter forces the system to work harder, run longer, consume more energy and ultimately shorten its life through wear and tear. Furthermore, a fresh, clean filter better traps contaminants and debris in the air. Once every 3 months, Energy Star advises changing your filter. During high use months, examine the filters at least monthly.<p>
