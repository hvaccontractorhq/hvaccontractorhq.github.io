Replace the filter if the blower is running but no heat is coming out. A filthy filter also triggers soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, decreasing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Current Evaluation: I am really delighted with Bob's Heating and A/c. My a/c broke and they came out the next day. They found the problem and changed the part and whatever works fine now. Their service individual, Steve DeLeon, was terrific. He provided me a courtesy call before coming out and shown up on time. He made the effort to describe whatever on the air conditioner and furnace as he went along repairing the air conditioning system and servicing the furnace. He was well-informed and polite. I was charged a reasonable rate. I will call Bob's from now on for any work associated to the services they provide.<p>

<h3>Air Conditioner Repairs Near me in Purdy MO</h3>
<p>Wow - simply wow. I never have become aware of the $5000 rule however got ta provide whoever dreamed that a person up credit for marketing. I have 2 furnaces - one indoors and never needs maintenance and one outdoors and needs annual or even bi-annual maintenance. There is literally not one part on that outdoor furnace that I can not purchase for less than $200 other than the heat exchanger. After my heat exchanger rusted out it was cheaper for me to buy stainless-steel tubing and quality stainless steel sheet metal and have a metal store craft one up instead of purchase something that is just going to rust out in 7 years - HVAC after market prices are simply crazy and all over the location and I think they know they gotchya" if you require a heat exchanger.<p>
<p>Devices costs are driven by the type of furnace at the heart of your home heater. Low-efficiency designs will cost less, but result in higher energy expenses. High-efficiency models cost more, but save more over the long haul. Costs for gas heating systems range from $1,360 for the low-efficiency designs up to $12,500 for high-efficiency models. Electric heaters begin at $395 and vary up to $1,700 or more depending on the brand and furnace size.<p>

<p>Have actually used the exact same company for 6 years to service my 3 systems twice a year. They give me priority and a lower rate when I have problems. Bought a new main unit and double zone system from them after getting 3 quotes. Never ever purchase extended guarantees or service agreements on anything but HVAC. Draws not having air for 5 days in the middle of the summer season. Great investment in my opinion. Never try to sell me something I do not need.<p>
