<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and ran Heating & A/c company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The choice of indoor units has one restriction: their total power must not exceed the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, however, it is really common to see a multi-split system with a total capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capacity by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better performance when all indoor units are turned on at the same time, since the overall capability of the whole system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Basically, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor systems in such a way that a few of the spaces may not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the calculation of the overall power is not basic, because it takes into account not just the nominal power of the units, however also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, etc<p>

<p>Maintenance service was excellent and on time. Josh was fast and extremely clear about his inspection, ensuring I understood what was watched out. My only negative is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To replace the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go buy a capacitor and replace it myself for $12. So perhaps a little steep on price for this service, however the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
