<p> Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has actually been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. If your ac system is short on refrigerant, either it was undercharged at installation or it leakages. Merely adding refrigerant is not a solution if it leaks. A trained technician needs to fix any leakage, test the repair, and after that charge the system with the proper quantity of refrigerant. Remember that the performance and efficiency of your air conditioning system is greatest when the refrigerant charge precisely matches the maker's spec, and is neither overcharged nor undercharged.

If the blower is running however no heat is coming out, change the filter. An unclean filter likewise causes soot accumulation on the heat exchanger, reducing the performance of the furnace and shortening its life.<p>

<p>Changing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires before disconnecting anything (you might need a referral later on). Then discharge the kept energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4).
