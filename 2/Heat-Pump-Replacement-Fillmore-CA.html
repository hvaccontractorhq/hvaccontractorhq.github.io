<p>Each volume of the ASHRAE Handbook is upgraded every four years. The Fundamentals Handbook includes heating and cooling computations.

This lessens the interior system footprint and permits each space to be adjusted separately. PTAC systems may be adjusted to provide heating in winter, either directly by using an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant flow to draw and heat the interior heat from the exterior air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While space air conditioning provides optimum flexibility, when used to cool lots of spaces at a time it is normally more costly than central air conditioning.<p>
