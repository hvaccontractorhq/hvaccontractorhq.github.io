<p>Let's start by detailing the preparation that needs to occur before you really buy a furnace. Selecting a furnace for your home isn't as simple as choosing one off a showroom floor.

<p>AC air handler squealing or grinding sounds. Though the majority of air handlers have direct-drive motors, some older units might be belt-driven. Squealing sounds from a belt-drive air handler normally take place when the belt that links the motor to the blower slips. In many cases, the belt is poorly lined up or used and requires replacement. Follow the directions above under A/c unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
