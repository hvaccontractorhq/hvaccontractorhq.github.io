<p>All contemporary a/c systems, even small window bundle systems, are geared up with internal air filters. These are typically of a light-weight gauze-like material, and need to be changed or cleaned as conditions warrant.

Failure to replace these filters as needed will contribute to a lower heat exchange rate, leading to squandered energy, shortened devices life, and greater energy bills; low air flow can result in iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air flow. Furthermore, really filthy or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or even fire.<p>
<p>As soon as every year to make sure all the systems are working well, you must get your HVAC system aesthetically examined at least. This inspection is a crucial aspect of HVAC maintenance.

Since you will have to hunt for alternative heating sources up until the system is fixed, that's the last thing you want. Regular evaluation and maintenance also helps keep it in excellent shape and lengthens its life.<p>
