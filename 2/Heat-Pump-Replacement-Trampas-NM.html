<p>Replacing a capacitor is easy. Simply take an image of the wires prior to disconnecting anything (you may require a recommendation later on). Then discharge the stored energy in the old capacitor (Photo 4). Use needle-nose pliers to pluck one wire at a time from the old capacitor and snap it onto the corresponding tab of the brand-new capacitor. The female crimp ports need to snap tightly onto the capacitor tabs. Wiggle each adapter to see if it's tight. If it's not, eliminate the port and bend the rounded edges of it so it makes a tighter fit on the tab. Secure the new capacitor (Picture 5) when you've swapped all the wires.<p>
