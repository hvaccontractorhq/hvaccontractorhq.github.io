<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. Initially, you need to examine your air conditioning system for ice on a semi-regular basis. This might appear a little ridiculous, however ice on your air conditioning system can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is really accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can accidentally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If completely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
