<p>Professional heater setups. However, even the best-maintained heater will eventually stop working. HVAC specialists recommend following this standard guideline when deciding whether it's worth investing in a repair: If the system is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the cost of a brand-new system, it's best to purchase new.

There are numerous kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be set up to achieve this.
