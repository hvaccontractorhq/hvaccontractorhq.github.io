<p>A packaged system, generally set up on the roofing system, is most typically utilized on commercial structures, however it is also an alternative for property owners to consider. Oftentimes, these systems contain not only the air conditioning unit itself however also a furnace. A benefit of this unit is surely the cost. Packaged systems are excellent for those wanting to conserve money on the installation of a new heating & cooling system independently, because the unit is combined. However, one con is that these units are usually only available for bigger homes due to their high power and capacity. Furthermore, while they can be a great way to save cash on a total HVAC system, they're still significantly more expensive than purchasing just a cooling system. For that reason, this might not be the very best choice for house owners trying to find short-term cost savings or those with smaller budgets.<p>
