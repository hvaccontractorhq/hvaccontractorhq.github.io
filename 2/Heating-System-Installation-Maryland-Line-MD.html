When you opt for Service HQ's duct cleaning services, you won't need to worry about a thing.<p>
<p>Not all sensors work the very same way; ours take a sample of the air every 15 minutes.

You get instant, real-time access to the tracking results through a control panel, which turns the information into visual charts that are simple to analyze.<p>
