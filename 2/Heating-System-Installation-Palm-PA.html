<p>Atkinson J, Chartier Y, Pessoa-Silva CL, et al., editors. When they laid a network of pipelines under their marble floors and tied them into a hot water supply, radiant heat systems have actually been around given that the days of the Romans. Romans used a wood-fired boiler tended by servants and a primary pumping machine to flow hot water that warmed their stone floors.

<p>Rather of tying in to the ducts in your house, a mini-split heat pump has an indoor head unit that mounts on a wall.

Since they don't require any new ductwork to be installed, ductless heat pumps are terrific for additions. Because a system is set up in each space or area you wish to heat, you can have greater control over the temperature of each zone, which can conserve energy. Some mini-splits even have occupancy sensing units that automatically raise the temperature in the space when you exist.<p>

<p>While pollutants typically discovered in indoor air are responsible for numerous hazardous results, there is considerable unpredictability about what concentrations or periods of direct exposure are needed to produce specific health issue. Individuals likewise respond very differently to exposure to indoor air toxins. Additional research is required to better understand which health effects take place after exposure to the average pollutant concentrations found in homes and which happen from the greater concentrations that happen for short amount of times.<p>
