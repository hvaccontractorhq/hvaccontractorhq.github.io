<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for a/c unit repair, which you need to keep an eye out for. First, you should examine your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioning unit can be a sign that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is especially real with the evaporator coil, which is actually accountable for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature around itself to the point that ice starts to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
