<p>For a heated flooring location less than 20 sq. ft., you could (most of the times) draw power from an adjacent GFCI-protected outlet without overloading the circuit. (If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI protected like ours, you can utilize any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad need to be GFCI secured.) But a bigger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair clothes dryer-- can trigger overloads and annoyance circuit breaker trips. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own electrical wiring and circuit breaker. Both 120-volt and 240-volt mats are readily available.<p>

DIY repair is possible, but the new control panel should be set up exactly right, wire-for-wire, or your furnace wonâ $ t work. Plus, if the problem isnâ $ t correctly diagnosed, altering a board wonâ $ t fix it, and boards are not returnable once installed. Itâ $ s smart to leave this repair to a pro to detect.<p>
