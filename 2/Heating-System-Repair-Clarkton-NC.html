<p>There are lots of reasons this can occur. The bright side is that you can resolve many of these factors on your own without the requirement to require expert aid. Start by opening the heat registers and after that carry on to examining the thermostat settings. Next, inspect the furnace power, reset the furnace or inspect the service door cover. You can also examine the filter to make certain it is clear of dirt and inspect the standing pilot burner to make sure it is lit.<p>

Follow the guidelines above under Air conditioning unit Not Blowing Air and describe your owner's handbook.<p>
