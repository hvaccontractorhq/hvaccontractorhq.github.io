<p>It's not suggested for uncertified people to examine & repair a/c & HVAC devices. There is a risk of electric shock & death if not properly trained in emergency ac repair check-ups. It would be best if you left it to a skilled ac repair Houston Midtown tech for correct HVAC diagnosis. Constantly make sure when examining your air conditioning equipment to switch off all main power from the emergency breaker panel or disconnect switch. Be extremely mindful when examining capacitors, even with the air conditioning system off. Capacitors can hold a high voltage charge, even with the power switched off. An unexpected discharge from an a/c capacitor can cause severe injury or death.<p>

<p>Four Seasons has installed both of my heaters and air conditioners, cleaned the ducts and done the yearly maintenance. I have found them to be reasonably priced, prompt and do great work. When they installed my main furnace they worked out beyond what was necessary and redid the whole plenum and the duct for the water heater due to the fact that the specialists thought they just didn't appear best and they could not leave them that way. No additional charge.<p>
