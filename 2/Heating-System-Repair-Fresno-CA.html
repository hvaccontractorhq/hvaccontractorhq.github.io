Failure to replace these filters as needed will add to a lower heat exchange rate, resulting in lost energy, shortened devices life, and higher energy bills; low air circulation can lead to iced-over evaporator coils, which can entirely stop air circulation. Additionally, really unclean or plugged filters can cause overheating throughout a heating cycle, and can lead to damage to the system or perhaps fire.<p>
