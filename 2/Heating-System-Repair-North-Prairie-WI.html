<p>Please schedule a consultation for a medical examination at the University Employee Occupational Health Center by calling 919-966-9119 if you believe there is a health concern related to the indoor environment. At this time, you will be asked to finish the Ask for Indoor Air Quality Investigation type (discovered in the Indoor Air Quality Policy). Please complete the type and send through email or fax It is very important when finishing the request that you supply as much detail as possible for the EHS Responder.<p>
<p>Sometimes a temporary indoor air quality problem is developed simply by a one-off, out-of-the-ordinary activity occurring inside a space or building, such as an overcrowded meeting area. In those cases, a short-term fix may be all that's needed, such as opening a window or bringing in a fan. But more complicated concerns-- recognized by regularly inappropriate air quality tracking results-- will need a different tack. Depending on the problem you're experiencing, one of the 3 techniques listed below might be suitable.<p>
