My experience started with Erik (sales) and he came out and was expert discussing my choices. After organisation hours Erik still addressed my calls to negotiate and go over alternatives. I arranged my set up and the group (Joe and Joe) came out right on time. They worked the whole time and addressed my questions as they were working. I never felt that I was in the their way. We were referred by a household good friend and now I will advise this company to my friends.<p>
