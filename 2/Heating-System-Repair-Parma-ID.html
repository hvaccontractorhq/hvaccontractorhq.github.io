<p>Hayes Heating & Cooling is a family-owned and operated Heating & Air Conditioning company in Kent, Washington that has been servicing the Puget Sound since 1978. The selection of indoor systems has one limitation: their overall power should not surpass the capacity of the outside unit. In practice, nevertheless, it is really typical to see a multi-split system with an overall capacity of indoor systems greater than the outdoor capability by at least 20%. However, it is wrong to expect better efficiency when all indoor units are switched on at the same time, given that the total capability of the entire system is restricted by the capability of the outdoor unit. Simply put, the outside system will disperse all its power to all running indoor units in such a method that some of the rooms might not have an extremely comfortable temperature level. Nevertheless, the computation of the total power is not basic, considering that it takes into account not only the small power of the systems, but also the cooling capability, heating, dehumidification, humidification, venting, and so on<p>
<p>A SEER score means Seasonal Energy Effectiveness Ratio. The SEER score of a system is the cooling output at varying temperature levels throughout the cooling season divided by the total electric energy input throughout the very same duration. Generally, SEER provides more data based upon how the EER carries out in different temps. The higher the system's SEER score, the more energy efficient it is. 1 An unit's SEER ranking can be found on the yellow Energy Guide tag affixed to all devices.<p>
