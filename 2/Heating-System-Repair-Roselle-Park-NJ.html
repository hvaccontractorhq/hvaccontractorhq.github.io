<p>I have 2 experiences with Ilan, both terrific. Just this morning I observed I had no heat. I called him, and he came over the very same day. He understood simply what the problem was and fixed it very quickly. However here is the BEST ONE. About ten years ago my entire air conditioning and gas heat went absolutely dead. I believed for sure it was a $20,000 task. Ilan had the ability to figure out it was a rat that chewed through a wire. He was so honest, he might have charged me for so much more.<p>

<p>The predominant health effect associated with direct exposure to elevated levels of radon is lung cancer. Research study suggests that swallowing water with high radon levels might present dangers, too, although these are believed to be much lower than those from breathing air including radon. Major health organizations (like the Centers for Illness Control and Prevention, the American Lung Association (ALA), and the American Medical Association) concur with estimates that radon causes countless avoidable lung cancer deaths each year. EPA estimates that radon causes about 14,000 deaths per year in the United States-however, this number might vary from 7,000 to 30,000 deaths per year. If you smoke and your home has high radon levels, your danger of lung cancer is especially high.<p>
