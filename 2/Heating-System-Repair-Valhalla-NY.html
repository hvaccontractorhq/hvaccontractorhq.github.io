<h3>Signs You May Need an AC Repair Service in Valhalla NY</h3>
<p>Maintenance service was great and on time. Josh was fast and really clear about his inspection, guaranteeing I comprehended what was watched out. My only unfavorable is that Josh let me know the power on my Blow Capacitor was low. To change the capacitor would be $170. I was able to go purchase a capacitor and change it myself for $12. So possibly a little steep on rate for this service, but the professionalism and service was excellent overall.<p>
<p>A pure maintenance agreement is unworthy the paper it is written on. Every technician will inform you clean the filters, take a pipe twice a year and clean out the compressor cabinet. Do not obstruct the vents. Vacuum the signs up a minimum of one a year. Vacuum the intake vent in your house. Now the "difficult part" once a year shut down the electrical energy open the furnace and really thoroughly vacuum the interior with a nozzle not a brush, don't touch the parts, close up the cabinet put back on the electrical power. You're done! 99% of the time you can not get to anything else and neither can the technician.<p>
