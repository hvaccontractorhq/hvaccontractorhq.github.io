<p>Dilution Ventilation. Dilution ventilation addresses the entire home. Air changes (exchanging indoor air with outdoor air) and air cleaning assistance figure out the efficiency of dilution. Air changes result from a combination of natural ventilation (infiltration; leak; windows) and mechanical (controlled) ventilation. When particulates are filtered and when air is dehumidified to eliminate wetness, Air cleaning takes place. The objective is to supply enough modifications to ensure a healthy environment. There are a number of kinds of heating and cooling systems with filtering that can be installed to accomplish this.

The Cooling Contractors Association (ACCA) offers guidance on duct sealing in its Handbook D: Duct Design.<p>
