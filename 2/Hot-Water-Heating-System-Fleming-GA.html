This reduces the interior system footprint and enables each room to be changed individually. PTAC systems may be adapted to offer heating in cold weather, either directly by utilizing an electric strip, gas, or other heating unit, or by reversing the refrigerant circulation to heat the interior and draw heat from the outside air, converting the a/c into a heat pump While space cooling supplies optimum flexibility, when used to cool many spaces at a time it is generally more expensive than central air conditioning.<p>
