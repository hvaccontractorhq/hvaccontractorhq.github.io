Sources of formaldehyde in the house consist of structure materials, cigarette smoking, home products, and making use of unvented, fuel-burning devices, like gas ranges or kerosene area heating units.

<p>The primary issue when installing a multi-split system is the laying of long refrigerant lines for linking the external unit to the internal ones. While installing a different split system, employees try to locate both systems opposite to each other, where the length of the line is minimal. Installing a multi-split system produces more troubles, given that some of indoor units can be located far from the outside. The very first designs of multi-split systems had one common control system that did not allow you to set the cooling individually for each space. Nevertheless, now the market has a large selection of multi-split systems, in which the functional attributes of indoor systems run individually from each other.<p>
