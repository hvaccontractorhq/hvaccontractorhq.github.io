If your contractor states they understand the size of air conditioning system you need based on experience or on square video footage alone, move to another contractor. Similar to determining the size of a system needed based upon BTUs, figuring out the proper size of unit for your home also depends on the unit load-- how much cold air it will lose by space.<p>
