<h3>HVAC Contractors in New Kent VA</h3>
<p>Variable speed is the way to go if it's time to upgrade an aging AC. Currently planning to replace an existing a/c? Presuming your budget plan accommodates a variable speed system, you should definitely get one! You'll feel more comfy throughout the summer months, and your indoor air will be whole lot cleaner. At the very least, think about a two phase compressor for enhanced convenience and performance.<p>
<p>While these steps will help to keep your AC system in top shape, know that there are maintenance products that just a trained HVAC technician will have the ability to do. For example, a slow refrigerant leakage in your AC system can lead to costly compressor failure, however a property owner doesn't have the tools or skills required to check refrigerant levels. Likewise, tidy ducts and correct airflow are important to a well-functioning system, but homeowners lack the required devices for the job. The bottom line? While some AC maintenance can be done by a savvy property owner, it's still necessary to have a professional technician check the system regularly.<p>
<p>Unstable organic substances (VOCs)-- These are the primary contributors to bad indoor air quality; they are ubiquitous both inside and outdoors. VOCs are natural chemicals given off as gases from procedures or items; for the most part, you can smell their presence. Typical sources of VOCs inside include things like cleaning agents, disinfectants, air fresheners, dehumidifiers, and more. (Even something as apparently innocuous as a brand-new carpet is most likely to be giving off formaldehyde gas.) Sources of VOC contamination from outside might include unpredictable chemicals in contaminated groundwater that are pulled within throughout water use.<p>
