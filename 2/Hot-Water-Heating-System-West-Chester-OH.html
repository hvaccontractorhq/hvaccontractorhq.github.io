<h3>AC Technician in West Chester Ohio</h3>
<p>Called WSE for a regular examination. The tech appeared right on time and was experienced & friendly throughout the go to. They suggested replacing a few parts that were heading out. They weren't low-cost however a quick internet search validated WSE wasn't pumping up costs, so I gladly had them changed. Nevertheless, a week later on the furnace quit working. I called and a tech had the ability to squeeze us in same day, the day before Thanksgiving. Turns out the igniter they set up the week prior was malfunctioning.

<p>I have actually switched to Bob's from my previous supplier since the 2 technicians I've had out for service are extensive, friendly, experienced, neat, and spent time exercising the problem. Bob's offered a full cleaning after a remodel kicked up a bunch of drywall dust, they got rid of the blower and cleaned the ducts. A little over a month later on, something was causing the power to turn off to the furnace shortly after kicking on. The technician invested a good amount of time locating the issue and after much head scratching, found a thermometer's insulation was coming lose producing a hot spot in the unit, triggering the furnace to shut down as a prevention step. The repair at that point was simple. Technician discussed the issue, the option and was on his method. Charged just for the diagnostic.<p>
