<p>Even if your central air conditioning conditioner is just 8 to ten years old, it could suck up to twice the electrical power that even a low-end new one would utilize. That's because it runs at or listed below 10 SEER, or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio, which is the quantity of energy needed to supply a particular cooling output. Till 2006, 10 SEER was basic, but these days, the minimum permitted by federal law is 13 SEER. That translates to 30% less electrical intake and 30% lower cooling bills than devices set up just a few years back.<p>
<p>Radiant heater don't use ducts, which makes them a fair bit more energy efficient than other systems. They likewise do not produce hot and cold spots.

Radiant heat systems can also heat spaces with less energy invested, and keep them heated up for longer, given that the majority of floors tend to keep heat better than air does.<p>
