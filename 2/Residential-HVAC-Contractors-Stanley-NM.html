<p>It may be time to clean up the condensing uni t Filthy condenser coils won't offer off heat efficiently and will keep the system running if the AC does not turn off. Another possibility: The contacts on the outdoor run relay might have welded together-- something that can occur in time due to the fact that of frequent electrical arcing at the relay. Prior to checking the run relay, switch off the power to the furnace and the condensing system. Next, disassemble the relay and pry apart the contacts. This need to suffice till you buy a replacement-- which you need to do soon.<p>
<p>Now, there are a couple of common signs of a requirement for a/c repair, which you must keep an eye out for. First, you need to check your a/c unit for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little unreasonable, but ice on your a/c unit can be an indication that something is seriously wrong with the system. This is specifically real with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can unintentionally reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice begins to form. The evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively if completely iced over.<p>
