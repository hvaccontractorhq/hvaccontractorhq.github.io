<p>Now, there are a few common indications of a need for air conditioning system repair, which you must look out for. First, you ought to check your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may appear a little absurd, but ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system.

The evaporator loses the ability to siphon heat effectively if totally iced over.<p>
