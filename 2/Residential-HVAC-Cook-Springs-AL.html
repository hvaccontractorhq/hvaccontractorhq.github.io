<p>Examine these 3 things first if you think that the AC's not working or you're getting little or no cold air. Ensure all the signs up in the house are large open. Then be sure the furnace filter is clean Then go outside and clean off the condenser coils (Photo 2). The minimized airflow could have caused the evaporator coil to ice up and stop cooling your house if several signs up were closed or the filter was blocked. If you've altered the filter and opened all the signs up and you're still not getting airflow at the signs up, deice the A-coil. Move the thermostat mode switch from Cooling" to Off" and move the fan switch from Automobile" to On." Let the blower run for a minimum of thirty minutes or until there's excellent airflow at the registers. Then turn the AC back on to test it. You have actually fixed the issue if it works for the next 12 hours.<p>
