(If the thermostat you acquire is already GFCI safeguarded like ours, you can use any outlet. In any case, the flooring heating pad should be GFCI protected.) However a larger mat on an existing circuit-- a circuit that may also accommodate a 2,000- watt hair dryer-- can trigger overloads and problem circuit breaker journeys. For our bigger mat, we chose to install a dedicated circuit with its own circuitry and breaker. Both 240-volt and 120-volt mats are available.<p>
