<p>Ducts running in closets use up less area than you might think. Due to the fact that a lot of ducts are 12x6 inches or 10x8 inches, even in a relatively small 2x4-foot closet, they use up just 4 of the 64 available cubic feet. Some cooling contractors may suggest utilizing "flex duct" (a small, inexpensive versatile hose) instead of rigid square ducts. However prevent flex duct in active closet areas-- it doesn't stand well to tear and use and is easily punctured.<p>
<p>Many trustworthy HVAC professionals will use totally free estimates with an in-person service call.
