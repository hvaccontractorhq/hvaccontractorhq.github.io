HVAC specialists advise following this standard rule when deciding whether it deserves purchasing a repair: If the unit is more than 6 years old, and the repair will cost over half the rate of a new system, it's best to purchase new. At the 15-year mark, it may be worth replacing even if it's still working-- the system won't have much more years left in it, and it's likely to be utilizing more energy than needed.<p>
