<p>An indoor air pollutant is a substance in the air that might affect the health of people who live in the house. Toxins might originate from outside the home-- such as an idling automobile engine in an attached garage, yard trash burning, or radon going into your home from the ground listed below. An air contaminant could also originate from inside the home-- such as carbon monoxide gas from a malfunctioning furnace, unpredictable natural substances (VOCs) from a freshly painted room, previously owned smoke, mold growing on wet or moist carpets, or chemicals from pastimes, household cleaning, or individual care products. Infections and bacteria, family pet dander, and pest parts (dust mites or roaches) are other possible indoor air pollutants.<p>
<p>A 3rd way to choose whether your home might have poor indoor air quality is to look at your lifestyle and activities. Human activities can be substantial sources of indoor air pollution. Finally, try to find signs of problems with the ventilation in your house. Signs that can show your house might not have enough ventilation consist of moisture condensation on walls or windows, stuffy or stinky air, filthy central heating and air cooling devices, and locations where books, shoes, or other products become musty. To identify smells in your home, step outside for a few minutes, and after that upon reentering your home, note whether odors are noticeable.<p>

Need heats up throughout the summer and winter season when customers need their HVAC systems fixed for relief against the heat and cold; service calls drop off when milder weather condition arrives.<p>
