<p>Perchloroethylene is the chemical most commonly utilized in dry cleaning. In laboratory research studies, it has been shown to trigger cancer in animals. Current research studies indicate that people breathe low levels of this chemical both in homes where dry-cleaned products are kept and as they use dry-cleaned clothing. Dry cleaners recapture the perchloroethylene during the dry-cleaning process so they can conserve money by re-using it, and they eliminate more of the chemical during the pushing and completing processes. Some dry cleaners, however, do not remove as much perchloroethylene as possible all of the time. Taking actions to minimize your exposure to this chemical is sensible. If dry-cleaned goods have a strong chemical odor when you select them up, do decline them until they have been correctly dried. If goods with a chemical smell are gone back to you on subsequent visits, try a different dry cleaner.<p>
