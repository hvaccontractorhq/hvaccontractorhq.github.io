He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call service several years ago and know the importance of having the best parts on the truck to get any task back up and running. I'm also impressed that he showed up at my home at 8:00 PM for no additional charge, on among the coldest nights of the year. I will certainly be using Waycoff's again, and would suggest them to everybody. Thank You quite.<p>
