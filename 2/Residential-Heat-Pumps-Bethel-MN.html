<p>RMI is working to alter that, beginning in California. As a primary step, in April RMI testified prior to the California Air Resources Board, asking the agency to set stronger indoor standards based upon the most recent science for NO2. The state of California has the authority to control indoor devices through codes, and after stronger guidelines are set there is a chance to deal with enforcement.<p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a colorless, odor free gas that irritates the mucous membranes in the throat, nose, and eye and triggers shortness of breath after direct exposure to high concentrations. There is proof that high concentrations or continued exposure to low levels of nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of breathing infection; there is also proof from animal studies that duplicated exposures to elevated nitrogen dioxide levels might lead, or contribute, to the advancement of lung disease such as emphysema. People at particular danger from exposure to nitrogen dioxide include kids and people with asthma and other breathing illness.<p>
<p>Lots of AC systems include a number of unique features that can even more improve performance and effectiveness. For example, homeowners may want to search for one that includes an integrated filter light that will signal you when the air filter needs to be changed. Another popular function to search for is a fan-only switch, which you can kick on in the evening to reduce energy expenses a lot more. Obviously, more functions mean higher central air conditioning costs.<p>
<p>It's on days like these that the concept of an in-floor heating system appears less like a luxury item and more like a requirement. (Besides, heated up floorings were good enough for the Roman Empire) But prior to you devote to what can be a major renovation project, it's best to ask yourself whether a glowing flooring heating unit is a proper solution for your particular house heating requirements.<p>
