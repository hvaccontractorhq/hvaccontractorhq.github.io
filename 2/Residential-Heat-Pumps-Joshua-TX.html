<p>I am really pleased with this company. Among my units blower fan motor was not working. The technician (Matt) detected the problem within 5 minutes of being on website. He had a replacement motor on the truck, and replaced it within an hour. I myself was also in the service call company several years ago and know the importance of having the ideal parts on the truck to get any task back up and running.
