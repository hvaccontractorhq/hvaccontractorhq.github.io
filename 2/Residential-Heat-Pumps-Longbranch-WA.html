<p>Air pollutants can range from pollutants brought in from the outdoors by your pets to unsafe gas leakages. Carbon monoxide is a typical air pollutant arising from natural gas that gets away into your home without being burnt. Older houses may include asbestos and lead particles, which can be damaging to the lungs when launched into the air. In restrooms and kitchens, mold and mildew can end up being an annoyance where wetness levels are typically higher than in the rest of your home.<p>
<p>Co2 (CO2) may not be the most pernicious factor affecting indoor air quality, however it is typically utilized as a surrogate for air quality and building occupancy level. The more occupants there remain in a room or building, the more CO2 is released into the air. To prevent CO2 levels from increasing too expensive-- which can have a negative impact on occupants-- outdoors air must be intentionally brought into the building through a ventilation system.<p>
