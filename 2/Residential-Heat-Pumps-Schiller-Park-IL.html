<p>I called Snowflake Air since my furnace was not working. Jose and his assistant showed up on time. Jose hung around fixing the problem, all the while discussing everything to me. After finding the thermostat was not working correctly. He had to go get the correct replacement. After the installation of the new thermostat, Jose described the operation and programing to me.
