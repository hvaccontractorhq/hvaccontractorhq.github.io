<p>Immediate results may appear after a single exposure or duplicated direct exposures. These include irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, headaches, dizziness, and tiredness. Such immediate results are normally short-term and treatable. In some cases the treatment is just removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution, if it can be recognized. Signs of some diseases, consisting of asthma, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and humidifier fever, might likewise show up right after direct exposure to some indoor air toxins.<p>
<p>The liquid refrigerant is gone back to another heat exchanger where it is allowed to evaporate, for this reason the heat exchanger is typically called an evaporating coil or evaporator. As the liquid refrigerant vaporizes it soaks up heat from the inside air, go back to the compressor, and repeats the cycle. While doing so, heat is soaked up from inside and transferred outdoors, resulting in cooling of the structure.<p>
<p>Air-source heat pumps are more popular in milder winter season climates where the temperature level is often in the range of 4-13 ° C (40-55 ° F), due to the fact that heatpump become ineffective in more extreme cold. This is due to the fact that ice forms on the outdoor unit's heat exchanger coil, which obstructs air flow over the coil. To make up for this, the heat pump system need to momentarily switch back into the routine cooling mode to switch the outdoor evaporator coil back to being the condenser coil, so that it can warm up and thaw. Some heatpump systems will for that reason have a type of electric resistance heating in the indoor air course that is activated just in this mode in order to make up for the short-lived indoor air cooling, which would otherwise be uneasy in the winter.<p>
