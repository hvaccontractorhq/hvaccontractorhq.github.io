<h3>Residential and Commercial HVAC Services at Piedmont SC</h3>
<p>Companies are needed to follow the General Task Stipulation of the OSHAct, which requires them to supply employees with a safe office that does not have any known dangers that trigger or are most likely to trigger death or major injury. The OSHAct also needs companies to comply with occupational security and health standards created under it. Companies must be reasonably knowledgeable about the possible sources of bad air quality, and they should have the resources necessary to recognize and control workplace risks. It is likewise their duty to inform employees of the immediate threats that are present.Specific state and local regulations may apply.<p>
<p>Some systems consist of an "economizer mode", which is in some cases called a "free-cooling mode". When economizing, the control system will open (fully or partially) the outside air damper and close (totally or partially) the return air damper. This will cause fresh, outside air to be supplied to the system. When the outside air is cooler than the demanded cool air, this will allow the demand to be satisfied without utilizing the mechanical supply of cooling (usually cooled water or a direct growth "DX" system), thus saving energy. The control system can compare the temperature of the outdoors air vs. return air, or it can compare the enthalpy of the air, as is often performed in environments where humidity is more of an issue. In both cases, the outside air needs to be less energetic than the return air for the system to go into the economizer mode.<p>
