<h3>Signs You Might Need an AC Repair Service in Eureka MO</h3>
<p>Throughout winter, the ground source heat is taken in by pumping an anti-freeze and water-based  solution through the system's geothermal loop field. The fluid flows around this loop, transmitting the absorbed heat to a refrigerant through the evaporator, changing it from a liquid to gas. From here it travels through the compressor, increasing the temperature level of the gas as a direct result of the compression process. From here, the gas transfers to the condenser, which moves the heat to the air blowing throughout the house's central heater.<p>

I am currently on the maintance strategy. He takes care of it two times a year with out needing to be reminded to do it.<p>
