<p>7 To test it, turn the thermostat to OFF, reset the power at the disconnect beside the compressor and the primary panel. Set the thermostat to a temperature level below the space temperature, and after that switch it ON. To avoid straining an ac system's compressor, wait at least five minutes in between turning it off at the thermostat and turning it back on. You need to hear the outside compressor run and see the fan turning inside the top. Look for an overload button or switch to reset (not all types have this) if the fan isn't turning.<p>

<p>Now, there are a couple of typical signs of a requirement for ac system repair, which you must watch out for. Initially, you should inspect your a/c for ice on a semi-regular basis. This may seem a little absurd, however ice on your air conditioner can be a sign that something is seriously incorrect with the system. This is particularly true with the evaporator coil, which is in fact responsible for siphoning the heat out of the surrounding air. When the refrigerant level in the system is low, the evaporator can mistakenly reduce the temperature level around itself to the point that ice starts to form. If entirely iced over, the evaporator loses the capability to siphon heat effectively.<p>
