<p>Luis was immediately responsive to email and texts with concerns. He dedicated to the task based only on e-mails, appeared and delivered with a 2 day reverse (Email RFQ on Monday, installed on Wednesday). Protexs offer was among the few affordable ones received. Others were almost twice the quantity Protex estimated for low end off brand name equipment. I got Provider. ProTex appropriately advised me versus increasing the tonnage of my condenser despite the fact that it would have made them more money (Sincerity) The set up group was respectful of my home and installed the devices in the anticipated amount of time. post set up inspection results look great for braising and pipes quality. New system cools better than the 13 years of age 4 ton R22 unit it changed (likewise Carrier).<p>
