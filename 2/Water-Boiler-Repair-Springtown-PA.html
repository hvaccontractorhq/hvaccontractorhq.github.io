<h3>HVAC repair services in Springtown Pennsylvania</h3>
<p>My house has 5 units, less than 2 years of ages. The 'repairman" found something wrong with 3 of them, such as a beginning capacitor for $45.00 (found it on Amazon for $6.95). Another unit needed "cleaning of mold" for $450.00. (I cleaned it myself with Lysol). Another require the drain vent cleaned up for an extra $30.00. (He actually stuck a store vac on the drain outlet for a few seconds!, I got a refund and complained) When this man belittled me for my "not understanding", I tossed him off the home.<p>

<h3>Commercial Heat Pumps in Springtown PA</h3>

<p>Great service within 24 hours and a fair price. The technician (Camryn) was on-time and extremely thorough in describing what services would be performed. Similarly Camryn supplied terrific client service at the end of the appointment by explaining exactly what he had done, the condition of our heatpump, furnace and tankless hot water heater. He made a couple of recommendations of some maintenance tasks we might want to have actually performed in the future, but without the high pressure up-sale strategies used by some in the industry.<p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that you may wish to talk to a Seattle HVAC contractor, as different heatpump units can have different heating and cooling capacities. If you already have a house heating unit, you might look for a heat pump more tailored towards cooling capability and performance. For a higher-end model to take care of your heating and cooling needs, you'll naturally want to try to find a model that will have enough heating for the cold Seattle winter seasons. The good news is that the one significant downside of heat pumps is that they can stop working in the cold or very hot temperature levels, which are nonexistent in the Puget Sound area.<p>
